% ==================== UrbanSim Bibliography ====================
%
% This is the master UrbanSim bibliography.  (We're trying to have a
% single project-wide version.)  The file lives in the cvs repository
%         /projects/urbansim2/repository/bibliographies
%
% To use, check out the bibliography into a separate directory on your
% machine.  Then, in a paper you're editing, make a symbolic link or
% shortcut to the urbansim.bib file in the separate directory.  Include
% urbansim.bib in the .cvsignore file in the directory for your paper, so
% that you don't try to check a copy of the bibliography into the
% repository for each separate paper.
%
% Entries are alphabetical by key.
%
% Conventions for keys:
% following the ee cummings tradition, keys are in lower case
%
% Generally keys are of the form lastname-where-yyyy or lastname-yyyy
% where "lastname" is the last name of the first author
% examples:
%    ashcroft-cacm-1977
%    epstein-oopsla-1988
%
% dissertations are lastname-phd
% example:
%    maloney-phd
% (no date, on the grounds that probably most people only do one of these ...)
%
% books are lastname-book-yyyy
% examples:
%    forrester-book-1971
%
% tech reports are lastname-tr-yyyy
%
% for obscure papers by authors that won't be cited ever again,
% or when sloth is rampant, the entry is just lastname-yyyy
%
% for book part
