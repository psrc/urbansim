\subsection{Diagnosing and Correcting Erroneous and Missing Data}

Developing the data for AZ-SMART involves the compilation of multiple
themes in the GIS and also ancillary files that are external to the
GIS.  A significant component of the SAM software is the availability
of tools to diagnose errors in the input data and to edit these data
to correct the problems identified.  AZ-SMART will contain a ToolSet
within ArcGIS that consolidates data diagnostics into a suite of
checks designed to identify problems that could impact model results.

Data imputation tools will also be developed to fill missing data,
or create data to match target distributions, or to use rules to
correct errors in the data.  There is some potential to use statistical
datamining tools and algorithms to provide more robust means to refine
data, but not likely during Phase 1 of the project.
