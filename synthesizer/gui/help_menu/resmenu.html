The Results Menu is used to display the characteristics of the synthetic population generated and has the following options available in it.

Once the synthetic population has been generated, you have the option to view results for the region as a whole or at the individual geography level. Choosing <b>Results -> Regional Statistics</b> will provide the following options:

<ol STYLE="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><b>Average Absolute Relative Difference (AARD)</b> shows the distribution of the AARD values of all the geographies for which the population has been synthesized
<li><b>P- Value </b> shows the distribution of the P-values of all the geographies for which the population has been synthesized
<li><b>Housing Attributes Distribution </b> shows the comparison of the different housing variables controlled between the numbers from the synthetic households and those from summary/ marginal files.
<li><b>Person Attributes Distribution </b> shows the comparison of the different person variables controlled between the numbers from the synthetic population and those from summary/ marginal files.
</ol>


</p>

<p>

Choosing <b>Results -> Individual Geography Statistics</b> will show a map of the region synthesized along with the individual geography boundaries. Here, you can select an individual geography with the select tool above the map to view the p-value and AARD value for that particular geography. The selection also displays a scatter plot of the number of different person types between the actual (from joint distribution generated using IPF) and the synthetic population.

<p>

The synthetic population results can be exported to Tab-delimited or CSV format files. This is done using the <b>Results -> Export Results</b> option. The layout of the synthetic housing data file and synthetic person data file can be accessed by selecting <b>Help -> Data Structures -> Housing Data</b> or <b>Person Data</b> respectively.
