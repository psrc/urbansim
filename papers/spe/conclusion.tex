\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

UrbanSim is both a vehicle for research on modeling urban systems and a
practical system that has been used in planning work in several
U.S. cities.  The software uses a modular architecture that allows models
to be written as independently as possible, and that provides for a clean
separation between the models and the data on which they operate.  This has
supported extensive experimentation with alternate modeling techniques, and
also supported implementing a system that is much more disaggregate and
responsive to policy considerations than others of its kind.  The primary
software lesson learned from this work has been the value of moving as much
of the complex functionality out of the individual models and into the
supporting infrastructure as possible; specific techniques for achieving
this include implicit invocation, efficient object representation in an
encapsulated object store, and extensive use of automatic generation of
code from declarative specifications.
