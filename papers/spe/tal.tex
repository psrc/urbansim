\subsection{Translation and Aggregation Layer}
\label{sec:TransAggrLayer}

The Translation and Aggregation Layer ({T/AL}) is responsible for
converting between different levels of spatial and/or temporal aggregation
from queries or updates and the objects in the Object Store.  For example,
models can query for zonal population totals.  The Translation/Aggregation
Layer computes and maintains these totals independent of the information in
the Object Store, which consists of population information at the grid cell
level.

At present, the {T/AL} is implemented using a set of methods in the Model
Coordinator, rather than as a separate component, and serves only to cache
query results for data aggregated at the zonal level.  The two key methods
that implement the {T/AL}, both in \varnm{ModelCoordinator}, are
\varnm{postQuery} and \varnm{postUpdate}, to post a query or an update to
the Object Store respectively.  However, as the system evolves and we
integrate models from increasingly diverse domains, we expect the {T/AL}
to become increasingly important as we need to share data at widely
different levels of spatial or temporal aggregation.  At that time we may
re-implement it as a separate component in its own right.
