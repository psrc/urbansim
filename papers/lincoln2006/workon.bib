	decision-support systems which have been advanced to date, indicating
	their strengths and weaknesses with regard to their ability to anchor
	public participation and professional collaboration in key planning

  volume = {2},

  number = {1},
  abstract = {This paper presents a model with rental housing vacancies in equilibrium.
	Because of the indivisibility and multi-dimensional heterogeneity
	of housing units, the housing market is thin. As a result, a typical
	household entering the market is willing to pay a premium for its
	most-preferred over its second most-preferred available (vacant)
	unit. This confers monopoly power on landlords, which they exploit
	by setting rents above costs. Free entry and exit force profits
	to zero, with vacancies as the equilibrating mechanism. A nice feature
	of the model is that housing vacancies are socially useful in expanding
	the choice set of entering households, though there is no presumption
	that the market vacancy rate is socially optimal. Thin markets are
	modeled by assuming an idiosyncratic component to households' tastes
	over housing units.
	
	The positive and normative properties of the basic model, which assumes
	costless search, are investigated. Then the model is extended to
	treat costly search. Finally, directions in which the model could
	usefully be extended are discussed.},

	of new housing supply is estimated using U.S. annual data for 1950

	as a linear function of new housing price and the prices of construction
	inputs. Long-run elasticities range from 1.6 to 3.7, suggesting
	that new housing supply is price elastic. Residential construction
	responds to both the real interest and expected inflation rates,
	but other construction cost variables perform poorly. However, the
	results are sensitive to the time-series processes underlying the
	variables. A modified model that expresses residential construction
	as a function of changes in input prices, rather than their levels,
	produces a long-run elasticity of about 0.8 and a significant inverse
	relationship between new housing supply and the construction wage

	affects both land rents and land prices in equilibrium because the
	conversion of land from agricultural to urban use is irreversible.
	Growth, on the other hand, affects urban and agricultural land prices
	but not the level of rents. We show that uncertainty (i) delays
	the conversion of land from agricultural to urban use, (ii) imparts
	an option value to agricultural land, (iii) causes land at the boundary
	to sell for more than its opportunity cost in other uses, and (iv)
	reduces equilibrium city size.},

	by S. R. Lerman and C. R. Kern [J. Urban Econom., 13, 358?363 (1983)].
	The paper provides an initial empirical test of the Lerman and Kern
	modifications, using household level data from Bogota, Colombia.
	The results of the model are evaluated by comparing forecasted bid-rents
	to actual rents and forecasted dwelling occupants to actual occupants,
	by examining the demand prices which emerge from the analysis and
	by comparing the results to previous housing demand research which
	uses a hedonic-type approach to analyze identical data. The findings
	of the study show that the bid-rent model works reasonably well
	in its predictions and in its estimates of the demand for attributes
	and, in some ways, it may perform better than a hedonic-type model
	in forecasting the demand for housing attributes.},

	of the bidding process that operates in these markets: the prices
	of houses are established through sequential bidding, so that sellers
	do not necessarily accept the highest bids that might be made for
	their houses; ignorance of the market may lead potential buyers
	to make bids that are either higher or lower than the ones they
	would make if they had complete information; and the distribution
	of bids for a house is truncated at the seller's asking price. This
	paper describes a bidding model that incorporates these characteristics
	of housing markets. The new model and the standard model are estimated
	econometrically and tested against one another using data from the
	Baltimore, Maryland, area. The test results indicate strong rejection
	of the standard model. It is concluded that the new model provides

	frameworks to model urban land use. As both approaches share the
	support of microeconomic theory, the main issue addressed in this
	paper is the theoretical comparison of the two approaches. It is
	demonstrated that in perfectly competitive land markets these approaches
	are equivalent, therefore they should be understood as complementary
	rather than alternative. The case of markets subject to speculative
	land prices is then explored for the cases of speculative supply
	and/or speculative demand, with the discovery that both approaches
	are theoretically equivalent in every case studied, thus extending
	the previous conclusion for the general case. These conclusions
	provide the base for an integrated and more comprehensive urban
	economic theory and for the bid-choice land-use model.},

	We formulate a microeconomic model of residential location choice
	behavior as an aggregate of the individual behaviors of household
	members, subject to individual time constraints and a common income
	budget. A simplified version of the model is estimated from stated
	preference rank-order data, yielding a function that may be interpretated
	as a conditional indirect utility function. We consider Box-Tukey
	transformations, segmentation by income class, and a consistent
	treatment of data at different rank depths using the simultaneous
	mixed-estimation method. Measures of the household's willingness-to-pay
	(through rents) for reducing travel times to work and study in the
	short run, are interpreted as subjective values of time and compared
	with such values derived from mode choice models. Our results are
	plausible, and consistent with recent findings showing that the
	short-run benefits of transport projects derived by transport models
	are larger than benefits measured at the land use system.},

  abstract = {A real estate market model characterized by incomplete information,
	costly search, and varying expectations is presented. The model
	describes a self-selection process for market participants and a
	distribution of transaction prices. These transaction prices, which
	arise from a Nash equilibrium, can be expressed as a noisy signal,
	reflecting incomplete information as well as the conditions of sale.
	The appraiser's role is formalized as the task of signal extraction.
	The model emphasizes the differences in information available to
	individual buyers and sellers, who make transactions only infrequently,
	and the appraiser, whose expertise comes from observing many transactions.
	Based on the model, it is shown that contrary to popular perceptions,
	appraisal smoothing is consistent with an optimal updating strategy.},

	This is done by means of an identification of key assumptions made
	in the process of the interpretation of reality as a set of algebraic
	relations; assumptions which, it is argued, underlie virtually the
	whole of mathematical modelling but which appear never to be openly
	discussed. An example of the use of these assumptions is then given
	in the theoretical development of the legit model of discrete choice,
	and the paper is concluded with preliminary recommendations about
	the future development and use of the mathematical model.},

  number = {1},
  abstract = {Real estate development from raw land to completed structures is a
	multistage process. Given the current view of development as the
	exercise of a real option, the question arises whether development
	should be modeled as a compound option. This paper tests the validity
	of the compound option characterization by determining whether builders
	start units for which they have permits and then complete units
	started consistent with the predictions of the real options model.
	To do so, I first identify a reduced form relationship between permits
	and starts and then between starts and completions. The parameters
	of this relationship indicate how well permits proxy for starts
	and starts for completions. Then, I determine whether controlling
	for this structural relationship, new information, and uncertainty
	in returns affect permit exercise and completion rates, as in the
	exercise of real options. I find that current and previous quarter
	permits forecast current single-family starts, while multifamily
	starts require more quarterly lags of permits. More than one and
	two year's worth of lagged starts numbers are needed to estimate
	current quarter completions for single-and multifamily buildings,
	respectively. The principal result is that once building permits
	have been obtained, the development process proceeds to completion.
	While there is no evidence that completion is the exercise of an
	option embedded in a start. some aspects of permits are consistent
	with builders treating them as an option for starts. However, even
	if they do, given permits obtained, it takes large changes in market
	conditions to affect small changes in starts.},
