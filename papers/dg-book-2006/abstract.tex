Decisions regarding urban transportation investments such as building a new
light rail system or freeway extension, or changes in land use policies
such as zoning to encourage compact development and curb low-density urban
sprawl, have significant and long-term economic, social, and environmental
consequences.  Further, land use and transportation decisions interact.
Integrated simulation models can help government agencies and citizens make
more informed decisions about such issues.  We briefly describe the history
of urban models, and present a taxonomy of needed refinements to them.  We
then present a case study of the UrbanSim model system and a significant
application of it to the Puget Sound Area in Washington State.  We also
situate this effort in the digital government research arena, in which is
presents a significant research opportunity: hard technical problems, unmet
demand from government users, and important issues around supporting a more
democratic planning process.
