\section{The UrbanSim Project: A Case Study}

UrbanSim is an open-source land use modeling system, which integrates with
an external travel model to provide a capability for integrated modeling of
urban land use, transportation, and environmental impacts.  It is reusable,
in the sense that it can be applied to a new region by supplying the
appropriate data, as opposed to being for a single region only.  Its
development has been motivated by the desire to refine both the models and
processes, as described in Section \ref{sec:refinement-taxonomy}.

Our research agenda draws broadly from the
academic fields of urban planning and design, public policy,
economics, geography, sociology, civil engineering, and computer
science, and balances academic research interests with pragmatic
relevance in addressing important social problems and public policy
choices.  Engagement with local and metropolitan governments and
planning processes has been essential to this agenda.  This
engagement informs the research in numerous ways, and motivates it.
We therefore devote attention in this chapter to the process of
adoption of UrbanSim by public agencies for operational use, and
examine two case studies of applying UrbanSim in the metropolitan
regions around Salt Lake City and Seattle. In this section we first
review the initial development of the UrbanSim project, and then
describe some of the significant research initiatives that we have
launched in response to lessons learned along the way.
