UrbanSim is a large scale land use and transportation simulator that models
the possible long-term effects of different policies on urban regions.  The
output is presented using indicators, which are variables that convey
information on significant aspects of the simulation results.  To support
their use, we designed and implemented the Indicator
Browser, a web-based interface for visualizing and browsing indicator
results in the form of tables, charts, or maps.  This interface was
designed and evaluated via design techniques including Value Sensitive
Design, paper prototyping, and frequent user testing.  The Indicator
Browser was implemented on top of an evolving system, developed using agile
test-first software development strategies.  This paper presents the
Indicator Browser as an illustrative e-government infrastructure case
study. We describe its interface and system design, implementation process,
and evaluation by a set of potential users, and discuss our plans for
deployment.
