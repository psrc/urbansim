We would like to thank all of the UrbanSim research team members and
collaborators, in particular Janet Davis and Sandra Fan for help with the
initial rounds of design and evaluation of the system described here; Batya
Friedman, Janet Davis, and Peyina Lin on their work on the design of the
Indicator Browser and interaction mechanism, on which this work draws
heavily; David Socha for software engineering help; Bjorn Freeman-Benson,
Casey Huggins, and Jonathan Fuchs for their work on the previous versions
of the system; and the participants in all of our user studies.  This
