The file res56-sevcikova.tex contains the final version of the paper sent
to ACM for the ISSTS proceedings.  The file preprint.tex is the same,
except that it has page numbers and a note in the bottom left that it is a
preprint.

There are other .tex files (main.tex and subfiles) that were assembled
together to make the final version, plus a few that were not used.  There
are also some updates to the final version not present in these other files
-- so only use these to mine for unused material for some other paper.
