    The variable opus_core.__version__ is set to this string (and maybe later in 
    all Opus/UrbanSim packages).  For stable releases, the version is something like 
    '4.2.1', where 4 is the major release number (i.e. UrbanSim 4), 2 is the minor number, 
    and 1 is the bugfix number.  For development versions, the version is something like 
    '4.3-dev3216' where 3216 is the svn revision number for this version.  When this 
    development version is first released as a stable release, it will become '4.3.0'.  
    The svn revision number is found using either the svnversion program (Mac/Linux) or 
    SubWCRev from TortoiseSVN (Windows) -- if the program isn't available or the code is 
    missing the svn information, the version for a development version will be e.g.
