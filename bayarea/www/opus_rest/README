Introduction
============

We run the bayarea model on many different model servers in parallel using
hudson.  Hudson offeres a convenient web interface and REST API for viewing all
of the state of all of the runs, but it has some limitations.  In particular,
hudson does not have access to urbansim internals.  So hudson can't report
things about the run configuration including run numbers and cache directories.
So we're augmenting the hudson REST API with this django app.  This alows a
client to get run state from the services DB.  This, in turn, allows us to
enrich our mtcstat front-end with more useful run data.

Setup
=====

-- Configure and create a mysql services db for your urbansim runs
   [more to come]

-- Create a read-only user in your mysql services db

   mysql> CREATE USER opus_rest_ro;
   mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR opus_rest_ro = PASSWORD ('******');
   mysql> GRANT SELECT ON services.* TO opus_rest_ro;
