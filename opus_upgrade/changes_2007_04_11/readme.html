<p>To convert an UrbanSim cache, or any directory containing &quot;flt_storage&quot;
files, produced by the numarray version of UrbanSim (version 4.0 or before) into one that can be read by
the numpy version of UrbanSim (version 4.1 or after), 
do the following steps in this sequence:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>

<p><b>Note: This must be done on a computer that has the 
same "endian-ness" as the computer that created the cache.</b> <i>(It is highly unlikely that you need
to worry about endian-ness unless the computer that created the cache was using an PowerPC, Motorola
or SPARC processor.  For more info, see 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">Wikipedia</a>.)</i></p>

	<li>Download the scripts from <a href="changes_2007_04_11_code.zip">changes_2007_04_11_code.zip</a>
      and unzip into a temporary directory on your computer.</li>
	
	<li>Run the <font face="Courier New" size="2">do_convert_numarray_cache_to_numpy_cache.py</font>.  
	The first parameter is the path to the directory to copy (the destination).  The second is the path into which
	the copy will be put (the output directory).  This utility will not modify the original directory
      or its files.</li>
</ol>
      
<p>For example, if you are trying to convert a cache directory on Windows at C:\cache\old_run to a new one located at 
C:\cache\converted_run, you would execute:</p>
<blockquote>
	<pre>python do_convert_numarray_cache_to_numpy_cache.py -d "C:\\cache\\old_run" -o "C:\\cache\\converted_run"</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case of a problem, or if your environment variables have not been set,
see usage information by executing:</p>
<blockquote>
    <pre>python do_convert_numarray_cache_to_numpy_cache.py --help</pre>
