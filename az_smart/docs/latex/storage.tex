\subsection{Storage}
Data used in AZ-SMART will exist in a variety of storage formats and
the system must be able to deal with data in these formats.  At a
minimum, these include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Geodatabase (MS SQL Server, SDE)
\item ESRI Shape File (DBF)
\item Excel Spreadsheet
\item ASCII, Tab and Comma-delimited
\item OPUS
\end{itemize}

ArcGIS provides built-in capacity to read and write to these formats
(excluding OPUS).  The AZ-SMART system will add a capacity to integrate
OPUS and ArcGIS by providing read and write tools for each of these
formats, leveraging ArcGIS built-in functionality and OPUS interfaces.
