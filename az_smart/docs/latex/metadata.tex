\section{Metadata}

In this section we develop a model of metadata throughout the AZ-SMART system.  We envision three places where one would want to track metadata.  The first place is in a pre-model data processing step where the user is bringing raw input data into the system to build a baseyear database.  It would be useful to track data on geoprocessing steps, SQL queries that were run, and perhaps OPUS tools that were used in the creation of the baseyear database.  It is likely that this would not be done very often.  The second place for metadata tracking would be Recording the details of the simulation run (e.g. models, specifications, configurations, etc.).  Lastly, we envision recording metadata for any post-model processing that was done.  For instance, any refinement to model results or indicators computed would be candidates for recording metadata about.

%NOTES TO SELF:  says stuff about the built in geoprocessing metadata, built in FGDC metadata recording in ArcMap/Catalog, a metadata database (include a data model), OPUS run configurations, etc.
