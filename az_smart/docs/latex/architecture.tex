\section{Proposed Architecture for AZ-SMART}
This document develops an architecture plan for the AZ-SMART project.  It is intended to provide an overview of the architecture from multiple perspectives: system, software, user interface, data and models.  Design choices are generally provided as recommendations, but in some cases two or more alternatives are presented for further discussion.  The intent is to update this document as design choices are finalized so that it can serve as an ongoing documentation effort.
