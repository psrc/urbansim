\section{Introduction}
This document develops an initial architecture plan for the AZ-SMART project.  It is intended to 
provide an overview of the architecture
from multiple perspectives: system, software, user interface, data and models.  Design choices 
are generally provided as recommendations,
but in some cases two or more alternatives are presented for further discussion.  The intent is 
to update this document as design choices
are made so that it can serve as an ongoing documentation effort.  It is very unlikely that the 
final AZ-SMART application will implement
this plan exactly.  Rather, it provides a point of departure, and a general map for the 
intended application, which will be adapted
continuously as the project participants develop, use, test, and refine components and 
their interactions and interfaces.  We strongly recommend that this project not be approached
as though this is a standard project being implemented from a template, like a contractor working
from an architects blueprint, but rather as a collaborative effort that is designed to work
together to solve problems faced by MAG and PAG in developing effective land use forecasts for
a variety of purposes.  This will involve rapid evolution and a high level of engagement, rather
than checking items off a list.
