\section{AZ-SMART Architecture Plan}
This document develops an initial architecture plan for the AZ-SMART project.  It is intended to provide an overview of the architecture from multiple perspectives: system, software, user interface, data and models.  Design choices are generally provided as recommendations, but in some cases two or more alternatives are presented for further discussion.  The intent is to update this document as design choices are made so that it can serve as an ongoing documentation effort.  It is very unlikely that the final AZ-SMART application will implement this plan exactly.  Rather, it provides a point of departure, and a general map for the intended application, which will be adapted continuously as the project participants develop, use, test, and refine components and their interactions and interfaces.
