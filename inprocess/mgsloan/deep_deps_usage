To use:

python deep_deps.py -xeugene/configs/eugene_gridcell.xml
This outputs each model in seperate gv files, and processes them with dot

python deep_deps.py -xeugene/configs/eugene_gridcell.xml -oout
This outputs all of the models and their dependencies into out.gv/.png

python deep_deps.py -xeugene/configs/eugene_gridcell.xml -oout -vurbansim.gridcell.total_improvement_value
This outputs out.gv, and runs dot to yield out.png, with the dependencies of urbansim.gridcell.total_improvement_value charted.

python deep_deps.py -xeugene/configs/eugene_gridcell.xml -oout -mland_price_model
This outputs out.gv, and runs dot to yield out.png, with the dependencies of land_price_model charted.

if -o is not given and -v or -m are, the variable or model name are used for the .gv/.png
