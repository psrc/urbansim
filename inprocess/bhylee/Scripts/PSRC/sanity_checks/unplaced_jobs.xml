	Ideally, we will have no unplaced jobs in any year, 
	although it may be acceptable to have a few in one year as long as there 
	are none in the next, just to give the developer model a chance to respond 
	do the demand.  However, a sustained pattern is not acceptable, and 
	probably indicates that the sampling rate for the ELC model is too low.
