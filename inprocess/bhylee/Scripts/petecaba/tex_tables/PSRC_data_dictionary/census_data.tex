{\bf \large Description}

A census block group (BG) is a cluster of census blocks having the
same first digit of their four-digit identifying numbers within a
census tract. (See also Census Tract.) For example, block group 3
(BG 3) within a census tract includes all blocks numbered from
3000 to 3999. BGs generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people,
with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by
local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant
Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated BGs
only where a local, state, or tribal government declined to
participate or where the U.S. Census Bureau could not identify a
potential local or tribal participant.

BGs never cross the boundaries of states, counties, or
statistically equivalent entities, except for a BG delineated by
American Indian tribal authorities, and then only when tabulated
within the American Indian hierarchy. (See also Tribal Block
Group.) BGs never cross the boundaries of census tracts, but may
cross the boundary of any other geographic entity required as a
census block boundary.

In decennial census data tabulations, a BG may be split for
statistical purposes for every unique combination of American
Indian area, Alaska Native area, Hawaiian home land, congressional
district, county subdivision, place, voting district, or other
tabulation entity. For example, if BG 3 is partly in a city and
partly outside the city, there are separate tabulated records for
each portion of BG 3. BGs are used in tabulating data nationwide,
as was done for the 1990 census, for all block-numbered areas in
the 1980 census, and for selected areas in the 1970 census. For
statistical purposes, BGs are a substitute for the enumeration
districts (EDs) used for reporting data in many parts of the
United States for the 1970 and 1980 censuses and in all areas
before 1970.


{\bf \large Procedures}

The data set was extracted from the 1990, TIGER/Line files. Each
county (King, Kitsap, Pierce, Snohomish) were extracted and using
ArcGis merge operation, a regional census block file was created.

{\bf \large Maintenance}

The data set originated from the Department of Commerce, Census
Bureau, Geography Division. Block Boundaries are released from the
Census Bureau every 10 years.
