The Center for Urban Simulation and Policy Analysis (CUSPA) at the
University of Washington, in conjunction with the Puget Sound
Regional Council has compiled a series of geographic coverage
files for preparation and use in the UrbanSim Model application.
The dictionary will provide information about the coverages
available in the data catalog. It will provide user a description
of the data set, how the data set was built, who maintains the
data, as well as item attribute documentation.\\

Full documentation is not available for all data sets at this
time. This document will be modified and changed as we continue to
receive and make updates.

All of CUSPA's data sets use the following project coordinates:

Projection - Washington State Plane, North Zone\\
Zone - 4601\\
Datum - North American Datum (NAD) of 1983\\
Units - Feet\\
Spheroid - Geodetic Reference System 80\\
