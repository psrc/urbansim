How to create confidence intervals for a refined run
====================================================
I. Prerequisites:
-----------------
1. Cache directory with the unrefined run (base year and a validation year)
2. Cache directory with the refined run (base year and what ever target years)
3. Observed data - tab delimited ascii files:
	- households2010_faz.tab (must contain columns faz_id and number_of_households)
	- jobs2010_faz.tab (must contain columns faz_id and number_of_jobs)
	Note: '2010' is the validation year and can be changed in the file names, if other year is used for validation.
	'faz' can be changed to 'zone' in the file names if a zonal validation is desired. In such a case, 
	both files must have a column zone_id.

II. Generate uncertainty measures for an unrefined run:
-------------------------------------------------------
	1. In run_bm.py script modify:
		cache_directory - directory with the unrefined run (I.1) minus the run name
		observed_data_dir - directory with observed data (I.3)
		output_directory - directory where output should be written
		validation_year - year in which to validate
		run - which UrbanSim run to use (i.e. number of the unrefined run)
		run_name_prefix - unique prefix of the run name within cache_directory
		validation_geography - geography for which to validate (only 'zone' or 'faz' allowed here)
	2.	Optionally: If confidence intervals are desired for the unrefined run, uncomment a line 'export_quantiles(...)' and 
					set the 'years' argument to the time of the target uncertainty (usually [2040]).
	3. Run run_bm.py.
	4. Output: In output_directory (set in step II.1) a file called bm_parameters is created containing 
				bias and variance for each quantity, households and jobs.
				Optionally (if 2. was set), it has files with the confidence intervals for the unrefined run 
				(see below about info on file names).
				
III. Generate confidence intervals for a refined run:
------------------------------------------------------
	1. Go through the steps in II. (step 2. is not necessary).
	2. In the script run_bm_from_file.py modify:
		cache_directory - directory with the refined run (I.2) minus the run name
		run - which UrbanSim run to use (i.e. number of the refined run)
		run_name_prefix - unique prefix of the run name within cache_directory
		pardir - directory of the outputs from II. (i.e. directory containing the bm_parameters file)
		output_directory - directory where output should be written
	3. In the 'export_quantiles(...)' call, set the desired target years for the confidence intervals.
		If needed, modify the propagation factors propfac_hh and propfac_jobs.
	4. Run run_bm_from_file.py.
	5. Output: In the output_directory (set in step III.2), there is one file per target year and quantity and
				each combination of a) no propagation factor (no suffix)
									b) multiplicative propagation factor (suffix propf)
									c) additive propagation factor (suffix propf_add) - this is the one to use!
				Files that have 'aggrla' as part of the name are aggregations to large areas.
