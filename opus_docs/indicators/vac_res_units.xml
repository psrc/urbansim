<definition>
For each year of interest, this indicator gives the number of vacant residential units in the selected geography.
</definition>

<interpreting-results>
This indicator is useful for seeing the amount of vacant housing at different units of geography.  
</interpreting-results>

<specification>
This indicator calculates the number of vacant residential unites for each queried year. For the selected geography 
and for each year of interest, we first find the total number of residential units, R. Then we find the number of 
placed households per year, P. Finally, the value of the indicator is calculated as R-P.
</specification>

<principal-uses>
This indicator is useful for both evaluative and diagnostic purposes.
