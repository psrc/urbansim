<h1>Reading Indicator Documentation</h1>

<p>This page briefly describes the sections of the indicator documentation,
and is intended for people who are reading the documentation.</p>

<h2>Name of Indicator</h2>

		<p>
            The name of the indicator is followed by a short definition.
		</p>

		<h3 id="interpreting_results">
			Interpreting Results
		</h3>
		<p>
            This section describes how to interpret the results from this indicator, either from a diagnostic
            perspective, a policy perspective, or both.
		</p>
		<h3 id="units_and_precision">
            Units of Measurement and Precision
		</h3>
        <p>
            This section describes the units of measurement for the indicator,
			e.g., <i>persons/acre</i>, <i>square feet</i>, or <i>unitless</i>.&nbsp; (An
			example of a unitless indicator is <a target=href="res_vac_rate.xml">Residential
			Vacancy Rate</a>, which is a ratio of residential units to residential
			units).  This section also gives the default precision used when  
			computing and displaying the indicator values, and whether it should be 
			displayed as an ordinary number, a percentage, or in scientific notation.	
		</p>
		<h3 id="related">
			Related Indicators
		</h3>
			<p>This section gives a list of related indicators that are also shipped with
			UrbanSim, with links to the documentation for each.		
		</p>
		<h3 id="specification">
			Specification
		</h3>
         <p>This section gives a human-readable specification of how the indicator can be
            computed.  Note that the <a href="#source-code">source code</a> may in fact compute the 
            value of the indicator in a different way, for efficiency or other reasons, but
            the result should be the same.
		</p>
		<h3 id="limitations">
			Limitations
		</h3>
		<p>
            This section describes any known limitations or problems.			
		</p>

		<h3 id="how_modeled">
           How Modeled
		</h3>
			<p>This section states whether the value of this indicator is determined by the
			interactions of UrbanSim's component models, or whether it is exogenous (that
			is, is determined outside the operation of UrbanSim).&nbsp; In some cases, the value of the indicator will be
			exogenous for the regional geography, representing the entire region being simulated, but not for sub-regional
			geographies.&nbsp; Since UrbanSim simulates the interaction among households, businesses and developers in the 
			real estate market, and the effects of transportation and land use policies and other exogenous factors such as 
			economic growth, it is generally impossible to attribute the value of an indicator to a single model component or variable as the
			principal determining factor.&nbsp; The changes in indicator values arise from the interactions within the model system, 
			and one can learn about the sensitivity of an indicator to changes in inputs only by examining the results of alternative scenarios.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<h3 id="source">
			Indicator Source, Evolution, and Examples of Use
		</h3>
		<p>
            This section describes where the definition and Python code for this indicator
            came from, and (if known) how its specification evolved, and examples of using this indicator. 
		</p>

<h3 id="source-code">Source Code and Tests</h3>

<p>This section provides a list of links to the source code for the Opus attribute or
variable that implements this indicator.  Please see the &quot;Generating and Visualizing
Indicators&quot; chapter in the <a href="http://www.urbansim.org/docs/opus-userguide/">Opus
and UrbanSim Version 4 Reference Manual and Users Guide</a> for more
information on defining indicators.</p>

<p>The attribute can be a so-called &quot;primary attribute&quot;.
This means that the value of the attribute is simply stored in the data
store, and not computed from the values of other attributes.</li>
Alternatively, the attribute can be represented as an Opus variable.
In this case, the value of the attribute <em>is</em> computed from the
values of other attributes on demand (although that value may be cached for
later reuse).  The name of the Opus attribute will have dots in it, for 
example &quot;urbansim.gridcell.number_of_jobs&quot; which indicates in 
which package it is defined.</p>

<p>For primary attributes, the name will be followed by the note
&quot;(Opus primary attribute)&quot;.  The name won't be linked to
anything.  Instead, the specification of the database table (or other
storage structure) that contains the variable is given in the
&quot;UrbanSim Database Tables&quot; chapter of the <a
href="http://www.urbansim.org/docs/opus-userguide/">Opus and UrbanSim Version 4 Reference
Manual and Users Guide</a>. 
An example is for the indicator 
<a href="res_units.xml">Residential units</a> -- see the item
&quot;urbansim.gridcell.residential_units&quot; almost at the end of
the description.  This is a primary attribute, since the number of
residential units is stored directly in the grid cell data.</p>

<!-- maybe sometime:
     The specific attribute name will also be in the manual's index.
-->

<p>For attributes represented as variables, the name will be a link, which
takes you to the Python class definition of that Opus variable.  The Python
code includes the method &quot;compute&quot; that is used to compute the
variable's value on demand, and also a unit test that can be run on demand
to test that the variable is defined correctly.  The unit test is also run
automatically whenever a new version of the source code is checked into the
code repository.  An example is for the indicator <a href="population.xml">Population</a>
-- see the item &quot;urbansim.gridcell.population&quot; at the
end of the description.  This is an Opus variable, since the population is
computed as the sum over the number of persons in each household placed in
that grid cell (i.e. whose dwelling unit is in that grid cell).</p>

<p>The variable name itself also provides useful information. 
The variable name starts with the Opus package name in which the variable lives,
such as 'urbansim' in the above examples. (Other variables might live in other 
packages such as a package specific
to a particular metropolitan region that is applying UrbanSim, e.g. 'psrc'.)  
The next word 'gridcell' says that this variable is for the gridcell geography.  
Finally, for Opus variables, 'population' (for example) is the name of the file 
that contains the Python variable definition.  (In the file system, the filename
also has a .py extension.)</p>
