\chapter{Glossary}

This section defines important terms used in describing the Opus system,
from a modeler's viewpoint.  In addition, there are a few
technology-oriented terms that might otherwise be confused with these
domain-specific terms.

\begin{description}

\item[Agent] \index{agent}
An object, such as a job or a household, that takes direct action 
on its environment, such as making choices among a set of alternatives.  
Typically, agents represent ``real-world'' objects from the model
domain.  Agents have state. 
Agents can engage in behavior, communicate, change state, etc. 
An agent's behavior usually depends upon its context.  

\item[Agent set] \index{agent set}
An object that contains a set of agents.

\item[Alternative] \index{alternative}
One of the objects that an agent may choose.

\item[Attribute] \attributesindex
A value that can be attributed to a particular object.  An
inherent characteristic of an object.  For instance, the UrbanSim
job object may have attributes \attributesindex such as ``id'', ``gridcell_id'', 
and ``is_in_scalable_sector_group''.  Attributes \attributesindex may be 
"primary'', \primaryattributesindex in that the jobs in the input database 
have values for that attribute. \attributesindex  Or attributes \attributesindex may be computed
by a variable \variablesindex definition.  There are no ``constant'' attributes. \attributesindex 
Models may modify any attributes, \attributesindex including ``primary'' attributes. \primaryattributesindex

\item[baseyear cache] \baseyearcacheindex
The file-based storage for the attribute \attributesindex values read from the baseyear
database.  Access to a file-based cache is much faster than to a database. 
Data cached during model simulation is written to a simulation cache. 

\item[Characteristic] \characteristicsindex
Synonym for attribute. \attributesindex

\item[Choice] \index{choice}
We avoid using this term because it is ambiguous: it can mean either
a member of a choice set, or it can mean the single chosen
alternative.

\item[Choice set] \index{choice set}
An object that contains a set of alternatives.  By convention, we use
this term instead of ``alternative set''.

\item[Category] \index{category}
A single state of a nominal variable, such as a development type.
Often used to group objects based upon their characteristics. \characteristicsindex

\item[Category set] \index{category set}
A set of categories.

\item[CUSPA] \cuspaindex
The Center for Urban Simulation and Policy Analysis \cuspaindex at the University of Washington
(home of the UrbanSim project).

\item[Dataset] \datasetindex
A set of objects, such as gridcells or jobs, of the same type.
You can think of a dataset \datasetindex as a table, with one column
for each attribute, \attributesindex and one row for each object.  
Each object in the dataset \datasetindex has a unique identifier (an integer) stored in
an attribute \attributesindex whose name is referenced as ``id_name''. \datasetindex  

In practice, a dataset \datasetindex often is constructed from a single
table read from a Storage object, though some datasets \datasetindex
are constructed by joining information from multiple tables.

\item[Logit Equation] \index{Logit Equation}
Also known as a Logit Transformation, this transforms the
collection of an agent's computed direct utilities for all
alternatives in the choice set into an estimated probability for
each alternative:
\begin{equation}
    P_{ij}=\frac{e^{\lambda U_{ij}}}{\sum_{j' \in J}e^{\lambda
    U_{ij'}}},
\end{equation}

\item[Estimated Utility Function] \index{Estimated Utility Function}
A set of paired variables \variablesindex and coefficients \coefficientsindex of the form $\sum
c_{i}*v_{i}$.

\item[Interaction Set] \index{interaction set}
A dataset \datasetindex of variables \variablesindex describing the interaction between two
different datasets. \datasetindex  See ``Interaction Variable''. \variablesindex

\item[Interaction Variable] \index{interaction variable}
A variable \variablesindex that computes the interaction between two different
datasets, \datasetindex such as that gridcell ``number_of_households'' 
variable \variablesindex that computes the number of households residing in
each gridcell.

\item[Logit Model] \index{Logit Model} \index{model!Logit}
A Logit model is defined using an indirect utility equation, which
includes the error term and specifies how that error is
distributed. For example:
\begin{equation}
    U_{ij}={\theta}{X}_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij}
    =\sum_{k \in K}{\theta}_{k}X^{k}_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij},
\end{equation}
\indent where $\epsilon_{ij}$ is i.i.d. distributed Gumbel Type I.

\item[Model] \index{model}
An object that defines behavior and that has a \verb|run()|
method.  Models have no state. They get their data from data
objects, and store their results in data objects.  A model can be
a formula that calculates on the data provided to it. A model can
be a sequence of actions to perform.  A model also can act as an
action.  A model must have a \verb|run()| method.

By convention, every model
module contains a set of tests that test that model.

\item[Model implementation] \index{model!implementation}
A model whose specification, or both specification and
coefficients, \coefficientsindex have been estimated to a particular data set.

\item[Model object] \index{model!object}
A model, or a model part.  Model objects act on data objects.

\item[Model component] \index{model!component}
An object that performs a logically distinct task that is part of
how the model runs.  Every model is formed by a sequence, and
perhaps cycle, of model steps.  Different models may 
combine the same model components in different ways to define
different models.

Note that models can become components in other higher-level models, such as a
land-price model and a neighborhood choice model that are parts of a
household-location-choice model, which is part of an UrbanSim model.

\item[Model specification] \index{model!specification}
A definition of what variables are included in an econometric
model.  Coefficient \coefficientsindex values may, or may not, also be part of the
specification.

\item[Opus] \index{Opus} The Open Platform for Urban Simulation, a new
Python-based \pythonindex framework for writing urban and regional models.

\item[Opus package] \indexii{Opus}{package} The term ``Opus package'' refers to 
any Python \pythonindex package built using the Opus framework and that follows
the Opus package guidelines.  The packages in the Opus base distribution
will all be Opus packages in this sense, as will contributed Opus packages. See
Section~\ref{sec:create-opus-package} for directions for creating your own Opus
package. 

\item[Python package] \pythonpackagesindex
A way of structuring Python's \pythonindex module namespace by using ``dotted module
names''.  See the Python \pythonindex documentation at \url{http://www.python.org/doc}.

\item[Resources] \index{Resources} 
A Python \pythonindex dictionary object.  It is used to contain parameters passed
between model steps.

\item[simulation cache] \simulationcacheindex
The file-based storage for the attribute values for the datasets \datasetindex used by the
models. Access to a file-based cache is much faster than to a database.  The
baseyear attributes \attributesindex are stored in the baseyear cache. \baseyearcacheindex

\item[]\item[Simulation cycle] \index{simulation cycle}
A set of sub-models that run in sequence before repeating.
Typically, this refers to the outermost loop.

\item[Submodel] \index{submodel}
A \ldots \emph{need to supply this definition}

\item[Time step] \index{time step}
The unit of simulated time between each simulation cycle. For many
simulations, this will be a year.

\item[Variable] \variablesindex
An attribute \attributesindex that is computed by a variable \variablesindex definition.  Each
variable \variablesindex definition resides in its own Python \pythonindex module.  The 
Python \pythonindex module for a variable, \variablesindex e.g. ``is_industrial'', is the
same as the variable \variablesindex name except with a ``.py'' extension, 
e.g. ``is_industrial.py''.  

\item[Work request system] \index{work request system}
A system for filing and tracking work requests, including bug
reports.
