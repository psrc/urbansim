  abstract = {Over 80% of new housing output is produced by private speculative
	housebuilders. In this paper we will examine the employment of standard
	house types in speculative housebuilding. We will present new empirical
	data, gained from a number of interviews with high-level technical
	and design personnel in fourteen large-volume housebuilders (between
	them responsible for around one third of housing completions). The
	paper highlights what the housebuilders themselves see as a `standard
	house type', the advantages of using standard designs (in terms of
	costs and in terms of skills), and the manner in which the portfolio
	of designs is continually appraised and updated.},

  pages = {1-24},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {This paper develops a quantitative method for classifying neighbourhood
	types and applies the characterization method to the neighbourhoods
	of new single-family homes in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan
	area. The study first measures a set of 21 urban form attributes
	in neighbourhoods that contain newly constructed single-family homes.
	Factor analysis is then used to identify a small set of dimensions
	that capture essential differences in urban form. Finally, these
	factor scores are used as input to a cluster analysis to identify
	distinct neighbourhood types. The results demonstrate that most new
	single-family homes in Portland are built in new suburban neighbourhoods,
	but a substantial portion of single-family construction is occurring
	in traditional and neo-traditional urban neighbourhoods.},
