\section{Installing Opus}
Opus runs on any platform that Python runs on, such as Windows, Linux and OS X.  Instructions for installing Opus, and UrbanSim, which is bundled with it. are maintained online at www.urbansim.org.  For users with a computer running Windows, it is recommended to install the \emph{Latest Development Version}, using the Windows Installer downloadable from http://www.urbansim.org/opus/installer/opus\_installer.exe.  Step by step details for using the installer are available at http://www.urbansim.org/docs/installation.  Follow these instructions on the web for the installation, and return to this document for the following tests of the install.  Please note that the installer actually launches other installers for supporting packages during the install process, and that you need to be connected to the Internet for the installer to download files during the installation (please be patient - the installation takes 20-30 minutes depending on your connection speed).

The software is being continuously developed and refined, with bug fixes and new features being added.  In order to get these updates, or to download and install other Opus Packages not initially installed, users will need an application that can retrieve updates and packages from the Subversion repository for the software.  Subversion is a version control system used by many software development projects, and there are many free software tools available for accessing it.  One of these, on the Windows platform, is Tortoisesvn, available from http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/.  Users can download and install this package, and it will extend the Windows Explorer file browser, allowing packages to be \emph{checked out} of the repository (downloaded for the first time), or \emph{updated} if they have already been checked out previously.  Subversion compares the version on your local machine with the version on the server, and if there is a newer version of any component, it will download it and replace the version on your machine with the most current one available.

To check out (download for the first time) any package from the Opus repository, if you have installed Tortoisesvn, right-click on the opus/src folder in the Windows Explorer, and the menu will contain new entries for interacting with Subversion.  Select the \verb#SVN Checkout# option, and use the URL: \verb#https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/trunk#, plus the name of any package you wish to check out.  The target local directory should be under the Opus\_HOME/src directory, and take the same name as the Opus Package you are checking out.  An example of this checkout dialog is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tortoisesvn}.  There are other Subversion clients available for Windows, OS X and Linux, and any of them should work equivalently well for obtaining Opus packages.  Eventually, this functionality may be embedded into the Opus GUI.

Once a user makes changes on their local machine to any content that has been checked out from the repository, the changed file will be inconsistent with the version in the repository.  In many cases, this is fine, but if the file is updated by someone else and checked into the repository, then the next time you update from the repository, you will have conflicting changes in the file you have modified.  There are tools available to reconcile the conflicts, but the best approach for most users is to isolate the places you want to make changes to a location that will not have collisions with ongoing updates in the repository.  A project\_configs directory is intended for users to create and manage their own projects.  If the user needs to modify Python modules within the various Opus packages, these can most easily be handled by creating another Opus package of your own that \emph{inherits} from the package you want to change, and contains only the modified versions of files.   Note that Opus packages can be updated from the repository at any time by selecting the directory (or all of them at once), right-clicking, and selecting the menu item for \verb#SVN Update#.

Once Opus is installed, it is a good idea to test whether it is installed correctly.  Since the installation involves downloading and installing numerous components (all managed easily by the Windows installer), there are times when a component does not download properly and fails to install.  Here are a few simple tests to ensure that Python and the key libraries were properly installed.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Start a command window or shell (on Windows, this can be done from the start menu \verb#run# and entering \verb#cmd#.
\item Type \verb#python# and press Enter (for brevity, I will not repeat the press Enter at the end of each command - it is implied).  A Python prompt should appear, as \verb#>>>#.
\item Type \verb#import numpy#.  It should just generate another Python prompt, which means it successfully imported the Numpy library.  If it fails, you will see an errror, and need to exit Python and reinstall Numpy.  To see what version of Numpy is installed, type \verb#print numpy.__version__#.
\item Repeat the import step with the following libraries: scipy, matplotlib, sqlalchemy, and PyQt4 (the capitalization matters).  If all of these import without reporting an error, the main libraries are installed correctly.  The version number for sqlalchemy should be at least 0.4.3 at the time of this writing.
\end{enumerate}

To exit an interactive Python session, you can type Control-Z, or quit().  Please exit Python before proceeding.
