  \item[``land_price_model''] \modelsindex - activates the \verb|LandPriceModel| \modelsindex which
  predicts residential and non-residential land value (see
  Section~\ref{sec:land-price-model}).
  \item[``development_project_transition_model''] \modelsindex - activates the
  \verb|DevelopmentProjectTransitionModel| \modelsindex which creates projects of different
  types for development (see
  Section~\ref{sec:development-project-transition-model}).
  \item[``residential_development_project_location_choice_model''] \modelsindex - activates
  the \\ \verb|DevelopmentProjectLocationChoiceModel| \modelsindex for residential projects
  only. It places the newly created projects of residential type into locations
  (see Section~\ref{sec:development-project-lcm}).
  \item[``commercial_development_project_location_choice_model''] \modelsindex - activates
  the \\ \verb|DevelopmentProjectLocationChoiceModel| \modelsindex for commercial projects
  only. It places the newly created projects of commercial type into locations
  (see Section~\ref{sec:development-project-lcm}).
  \item[``industrial_development_project_location_choice_model''] \modelsindex - activates
  the \\ \verb|DevelopmentProjectLocationChoiceModel| \modelsindex for industrial projects
  only. It places the newly created projects of industrial type into locations
  (see Section~\ref{sec:development-project-lcm}).
  \item[``development_event_transition_model''] \modelsindex - activates the
  \verb|DevelopmentEventTransitionModel| \modelsindex which creates development events from
  given projects (see Section~\ref{sec:development-event-transition-model}) and
  the \verb|EventsCoordinator| which processes the actual annual development
  (see Section~\ref{sec:events-coordinator}).
  \item[``residential_land_share_model''] \modelsindex - activates the
  \verb|ResidentialLandShareModel| \modelsindex which predicts the fraction of residential
  land (see Section~\ref{sec:residential-land-share-model}).
  \item[``household_transition_model''] \modelsindex - activates the
  \verb|HouseholdTransitionModel| \modelsindex which simulates deaths and births in the
  population of households (see Section~\ref{sec:household-transition-model}).
  \item[``employment_transition_model''] \modelsindex - activates the
  \verb|EmploymentTransitionModel| \modelsindex which simulates creation and loss of jobs
  (see Section~\ref{sec:employment-transition-model}).
  \item[``household_relocation_model''] \modelsindex - activates the
  \verb|AgentRelocationModel| \modelsindex where agents are set to be households. It
  determines which households will move to another locations in the simulated
  year (see Section~\ref{sec:agent-relocation-model}).
  \item[``household_location_choice_model''] \modelsindex - activates the
  \verb|AgentLocationChoiceModel| \modelsindex where agents are set to be households. It
  places moving households to another locations (see
  Section~\ref{sec:agent-lcm}).
  \item[``employment_relocation_model''] \modelsindex - activates the
  \verb|AgentRelocationModel| \modelsindex where agents are set to be jobs. It determines
  which jobs will be moved to another locations in the simulated year (see
  Section~\ref{sec:agent-relocation-model}).
  \item[``employment_location_choice_model''] \modelsindex - activates the
  \verb|AgentLocationChoiceModelMember| \modelsindex where agents are set to those types of jobs
  that are contained in the table \file{job_building_types}.
  For each type, it places moving jobs to another locations (see
  Section~\ref{sec:elcm}). An exception is the type 'governmental' for which the \verb|ScalingJobsModel| is activated
  (see Section~\ref{sec:scaling-jobs-model}).
  \item[``distribute_unplaced_jobs_model''] \modelsindex - activates the \verb|DistributeUnplacedJobsModel| \modelsindex which
  places  all non-placed jobs randomly to another locations (see Section~\ref{sec:distribute-unplaced-jobs-model}).
