<h1>Opus Revisions and Releases</h1>

<p>Periodically we make a stable release of Opus and UrbanSim.  These stable releases have version numbers such as 4.2.0 
(where this is for Opus/UrbanSim version 4, minor number 2, bugfix number 1).  In addition, we have a development version of the system, which
we update very frequently.  Most users will want the latest stable release of the system; developers and others
who are working closely with the core development team will want the current development version.
All of these releases are available from our subversion repository at
<a href="https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/">https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/</a>.</p>

<p>The stable releases are under this URL: 
<a href="https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/">https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/</a>.
For example, version 4.2.0 is at
<a href="https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/4.2.0/">https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/4.2.0/</a>.</p>

<p>The current development version is under this URL: 
<a href="https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/trunk/">https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/trunk/</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, you will notice a <tt>branches</tt> directory under https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/branches.
This is for branches off of the main trunk -- generally users shouldn't need to be concerned with those.  (Branches are used,
for example, for stable releases -- a given release is just a tagged revision in a branch.)
