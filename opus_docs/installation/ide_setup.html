<h1>Installing Opus and UrbanSim using an IDE (Interactive
Development Environment)</h1>
<h2>Choosing a Development Environment </h2>

<p>In general, if you are doing much software development, you
will benefit a
lot from using an
integrated development environment (IDE) that supports for the range of
activities involved in, such as such as editing code, running tests,
debugging code, connecting to a code repository, etc.&nbsp; There
are numerous such IDEs for
Python, and unfortunately no one IDE fits all needs.&nbsp; Within
CUSPA, we tend
to use one of three editors for Python, and one of three editors for
LaTeX
files. </p>

<p>Configure your Python editor appropriately.&nbsp; The
software developers in
CUSPA typically use Eclipse for talking to subversion, Wing for debugging, and
either
or both for editing Python code.&nbsp; Here are instructions for <a href="wing.html">configuring Wing</a> and <a href="eclipse.html">configuring Eclipse</a>. </p>

<p>If you need to edit the Opus and UrbanSim Reference Manual and
Users Guide
(as opposed to just reading it), you&rsquo;ll need to use <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> since
our documentation
is written in LaTeX.&nbsp; Here are instructions for configuring a <a href="latex.html">installing
and configuring a LATEX document preparation system</a>. </p>

<h2>Getting the Code for the Opus Packages </h2>


<ol>
<li>Download the desired Opus packages from the CUSPA subversion repository
at <a href="https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus">https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus</a>
and put them into your workspace directory. </li>

  <li>Make sure that your workspace directory is in your
PYTHONPATH.</li>

</ol>

<p>You now should have a directory structure similar to the
following: </p>

<pre>C:\opusworkspace<br> opus_core/ &lt;-- if this is one of the packages you got from subversion<br> urbansim/ &lt;-- another package from subversion<br> ...<br> atlantis/<br> docs/<br> ...<br> __init__.py<br> opus_package_info.py</pre>

<p>Now you can make changes to the <font face="Courier New" size="2">atlantis</font>
and other Opus packages in your workspace, and use subversion to keep track of
the
changes between your copies of the Opus packages and those in the CUSPA
repository, update your copies with changes from the repository, etc. </p>

<p>Note that the code in the suversion repository is updated
frequently (often
multiple times per day). If you do not frequently update your code from
the
repository, it will become very difficult to keep your changes in
synch with
the code in the repository. Be warned! </p>

<p>If you make a change that you believe merits inclusion in the
CUSPA
repository, please let us know so that we may incorporate that change
into the
repository. The more we all improve the code, the better for all of us.
</p>
