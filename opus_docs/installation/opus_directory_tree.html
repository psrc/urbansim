<h1>The Opus Directory Tree</h1>

<p>The Opus GUI uses xml configuration files that specify the model configuration, where the data is located, and so forth.  
These project files expect a particular directory layout.  The base directory for an opus installation 
(called <tt>opus</tt> by default) should contain the following subdirectories and files:
<pre>
opus/
    data/
        eugene_gridcell/
            baseyear_cache/
                1980/
                    [baseyear cache files here]
            runs/
                [the system will put directories for run results here]
        seattle_parcel/
            baseyear_cache/
                2000/
                    [baseyear cache files here]
            runs/
                [the system will put directories for run results here]
    docs/
        installation/
        opus-userguide.pdf
    project_configs/
        eugene_gridcell_default.xml
        seattle_parcel_default.xml
        [other personal xml project configurations go here]
    settings/
        database_server_configurations.xml
        gui_config.xml
    src/
        opus_core/
        urbansim/
        [all the other Python packages]
</pre>

<p>A zip file containing this entire directory structure,
is available on the 
<a href="http://www.urbansim.org/download/#latest_dev">download page</a>.
Be sure and get the zip file corresponding to the version of the code you
are using.<p/>

<p>
You can unzip this to a convenient location on your local disk (say your
home directory).  The environment variable
<tt>OPUS_HOME</tt> should point to the location of the <tt>opus</tt>
directory.  You can optionally have an environment
variable <tt>OPUS_DATA_PATH</tt> that points to the <tt>data</tt>
directory; if this variable is missing it defaults to
<tt>OPUS_HOME</tt> plus <tt>data</tt>.  The <tt>settings</tt> subdirectory
contains configuration information for database server cofigurations and for
preference settings for the GUI; you shouldn't need to do anything with
this. The <tt>src</tt> directory is empty in the development version --
populate this from the subversion repository.  (Or you can keep your source
code in a different directory; it doesn't need to be at this location.
Make sure your <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt> variable is correctly set to point to
the source code directory, wherever you put it.)  Finally, in the
development version of the zip file, <tt>docs</tt> is also empty -- you can
find the latest
documentation <a href="http://www.urbansim.org/download/#latest_dev">here</a>.
Documentation for the exact version that you have checked out from
subversion is in the project <tt>opus_docs</tt>.
