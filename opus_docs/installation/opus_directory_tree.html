<h1>The Opus Directory Tree</h1>

<p>The Opus GUI uses xml configuration files that specify the model configuration, where the data is located, and so forth.  
These project files expect a particular directory layout.  The base directory for an opus installation 
(called <tt>opus</tt> by default) should contain the following subdirectories and files:
<pre>
opus
    src
        opus_core
        urbansim
        (all the other Python packages)
    docs
        installation
        opus_userguide.pdf
        opus_userguide
            (files for the html version of userguide go here)
        tutorials
    project_configs
        eugene_gridcell.xml
        seattle_parcel.xml
        (other personal xml project configurations go here)
    gui
        gui_config.xml
    data
        eugene_gridcell
            baseyear_cache
                1980
                    (baseyear cache files here)
            runs
                (the system will put directories for run results here)
        seattle_parcel
            baseyear_cache
                2000
                    (baseyear cache files here)
            runs
                (the system will put directories for run results here)
</pre>

A zip file containing this entire directory structure for the 4.2-dev development version, 
including the Eugene and Seattle data, is available at 
<a href="http://www.urbansim.org/opus/releases/opus-4-2-dev/opus-4-2-dev.tar.gz">http://www.urbansim.org/opus/releases/opus-4-2-dev/opus-4-2-dev.tar.gz</a>.

You can unzip this to a convenient location on your local disk (say your home directory).  The environment variable 
<tt>OPUS_HOME</tt> should point to the location of the <tt>opus</tt> directory.  You can optionally have an environment 
variable <tt>OPUS_DATA_PATH</tt> that points to the <tt>data</tt> directory; if this variable is missing it defaults to 
<tt>OPUS_HOME</tt> plus <tt>data</tt>.  The <tt>gui</tt> subdirectory contains configuration information for the GUI itself; 
you shouldn't need to do anything with this. The <tt>src</tt> directory is empty in the development version -- populate this 
from the subversion repository.  (Or you can keep your source code in a different directory; it doesn't need to be at this 
location.  Make sure your <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt> variable is correctly set to point to the source code directory, wherever 
you put it.)  Finally, in the development version of the zip file, <tt>docs</tt> is also empty -- you can find the latest 
documentation <a href="http://www.urbansim.org/download/#latest_dev">here</a>.  Documentation for the exact version that you have checked 
out from subversion is in the project <tt>opus_docs</tt>.
