<h1>Installing Python Packages</h1>

<p>Some additional Python libraries are required, recommended, or optional
for use with Opus.&nbsp; You must have the required libraries to run
Opus.&nbsp; The recommended libraries are not necessary to run Opus, but
certain functionality will be unavailable without them.&nbsp; The optional
libraries are Python modules that are needed only in special
cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We've listed version numbers for the packages, and have tested the
  Opus/UrbanSim code with those versions.  Generally you should also be
  able to use more recent versions of the packages, except as specifically noted.</p>

<p>Caution! For binary versions of the packages, the package you need
depends on the version of Python you are using.  Be sure you have the right
one.  In most cases, the Python version number (e.g. 2.5) will be part of the
filename.</p>

<p>Some of these packages are available for download from
the <a href="http://www.urbansim.org/opus/third-party/">UrbanSim
third-party software directory</a>.  (The advantage of getting the packages
from the UrbanSim third-party directory is that we've tested the system
with this particular set of versions.)  We will also provide links to
websites where they can be downloaded below.</p>

<p>In many cases, obtaining these packages is made simpler by the use of
 Easy Install, a Python module that can help you download and build Python
 packages.  For more on Easy
 Install, <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall">visit
 the PEAK webpage</a>.

<p>Download <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py">ez_setup.py</a> to 
	your computer.  Run it (from the directory it's in) by typing
	
<pre>$ python ez_setup.py</pre>

You can use Easy Install to download and install a package, or to install a package 
(either a *.egg file or a *.tar.gz) already downloaded to your computer.  To install 
downloaded package, type the following at the command prompt:
<pre>$ easy_install [<i>filename</i>]</pre>
where [<i>filename</i>] is the path from your current location of the downloaded file.</p>

<h2><i>Required</i> Python Packages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>numpy 1.2.1</b>
        (<a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">http://numpy.scipy.org/</a>) is
        a fast array-processing library used throughout Opus.  (Earlier versions, back to 1.0.4,
        currently work as well, but if you are downloading a fresh numpy get the new one.)</li>
      
      <li><b>scipy 0.7.0</b> (currently at 0.7.0rc2, but presumably soon to be 0.7.0)
        (<a href="http://www.scipy.org/">http://www.scipy.org/</a>) is
        open-source software for mathematics, science, and
        engineering. Generally you need to get a version of scipy that is
        compatible with your numpy version.  Opus needs the scipy.ndimage
        package. <i> (If you have trouble installing scipy you
        can <a href="scipy.html">install just the ndimage
        packages</a>.)</i></li>
          
      <li><b>SQLAlchemy 0.4.5</b> (or greater) (<a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org">http://www.sqlalchemy.org</a>)
        allows programmatic access to a variety of database engines.</li>

      <li><b>Elixir 0.6.0</b> (or greater) (<a href="http://elixir.ematia.de/trac/wiki">http://elixir.ematia.de</a>)
        is a declarative layer on top of the SQLAlchemy library.</li>

      <li><b>matplotlib 0.98.5.2</b> (<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/</a>)
        is a quite full-featured Python package for creating plots and graphs.</li>
        
     <li><b>PyQt 4.4.4 (or greater)</b> (<a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/">http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/</a>) is a
     package that allows Python to interface with the Qt application framework to produce nice graphical user interfaces.
     This requires Qt to run.  For windows, there is a downloadable *.exe file on the Riverbank Computing downloads page that contains Qt, PyQt, and everything to
     create the necessary bindings.  For Mac and Linux, you will need to download and install Qt separately.  There are more details on this on the Riverbank Computing webpage.</li>
        
    </ul>
<h2><i>Recommended</i> Python Packages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are using MySQL, install <b>MySQL-python 1.2.2</b> (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python</a>).&nbsp;
        This
        provides our connection from Python to MySQL.&nbsp;&nbsp;(If you will
        build this package from scratch, you will need to install the
        mysql-devel package, too.)</li>
        
    </ul>
<h2><i>Optional </i>Python Packages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are using R, install <b>RPy</b> (<a href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/">http://rpy.sourceforge.net/</a>).&nbsp;
        This
        is a Python interface for the statistical programming language R (tested
        with version 0.4.6).</li>
    <li>If you need to use .dbf files (for example, those produced by ArcGIS),
        install <b>dbfpy</b> (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dbfpy">http://sourceforge.net/projects/dbfpy</a>).</li>
    </ul>
