<p>First, decide whether you want to use a stable release or the development version.  For most users,
the latest stable release is the best option.  Pick the development version for the latest features but at
the cost of code that may be less stable and that changes frequently.  (See
<a href="releases.html">Opus Revisions and Releases</a> for more information on version numbers.)</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="zip_file">Getting the Sample Data and Configurations</h2>

<p>We provide a zip file that includes sample data for Eugene and Seattle projects, template configurations for running simulations 
using these projects, and a source code directory.
Download the zip file with sample data and configurations for either a stable release the latest development version 
from <a href="http://www.urbansim.org/download/">the Opus/UrbanSim download page</a>.  Be sure and get the zip file corresponding to
your chosen version (a stable release or latest development version).
Unzip the file, which will result in a directory called <tt>opus</tt> with various subdirectories.  Put
this directory some convenient place on your local disk. (We suggest putting it in your home directory.)
See <a href="opus_directory_tree.html">Opus Directory Tree</a> for more information on these directories and
sample data.</p>

<h2><a name="stable_source">Getting the Source Code for a Stable Release</h2>

<p>The zip file has a subdirectory <tt>src</tt> that already has the code for the basic packages for running
Opus/UrbanSim.  If you don't need any additional packages, and if you aren't modifying the code,
this is all you need.</p>

<p>If you want to get the rest of the packages, to upgrade to a new stable release, or to switch to the development version of the code, 
you should check out the
source code directly from our subversion repository. &nbsp;(For you modeler
types, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>
in this context is the name of a version control system that nicely
manages keeping track of different versions of the code; we're not
talking politics.) &nbsp;Using subversion, it is easy to update to newer versions of
Opus/UrbanSim and merge in any changes you've made. &nbsp;You can also
request any particular version of the code from subversion.
&nbsp;However, you do have to have a subversion client installed on
your machine.</p>

<p>Before getting the code using subversion, delete all the files in the <tt>src</tt> directory that come
with the zip file.  (We will be
replacing them with files from the repository, augmented with svn information.)</p>

<p>Here are two ways to get the code. The source code directory will have subdirectories with
the code for opus_core, urbansim, and other packages, and also a file
docs with all of the documentation for that version. &nbsp;The manual
is in the subdirectory <i>opus_docs/manual</i> of the opus workspace, 
and the tutorials are in the <i>tutorials</i> subdirectory.</p>

<p>These directions assume that you are getting the latest stable release.  Substitute a specific version
number if you want a different stable release -- the available stable releases are listed on 
<a href="http://www.urbansim.org/download/">the Opus/UrbanSim download page</a>; or you can see
a list by looking directly at the source code repository:
<a href="https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/">https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/</a>.

<h3>Option 1: Getting Opus and UrbanSim using a command line interface to subversion</h3>

<p>First, make sure you have a subversion client installed (<tt>svn</tt>). If not, you can get one 
from <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html</a>. &nbsp;
Next, in a shell (i.e. a terminal window or DOS window), type the following commands.  These commands assume you start the shell in
whatever directory holds your <tt>opus</tt> directory.</p>

<p>If you have a fast connection, the simplest thing is to get all of the 
Opus packages at once using these commands:</p>
<pre>
cd opus
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/latest-stable-release/ src
</pre>

<p>This command checks out all of the opus packages into the <tt>src</tt> directory.</p>

<p>To check out a different stable release (e.g. 4.2.0), use a URL like this instead:</p>

<pre>
cd opus
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/4.2.0/ src
</pre>

(<tt>latest-stable-release</tt> will be the same as the last-numbered specific version, but using 
<tt>latest-stable-release</tt> makes it easier to update to new releases.)

<p>Alternatively, if you have a slow connection or limited disk space, you can
check out just the minimal set of packages needed for the tutorial:</p>
<pre>
cd opus/src
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/latest-stable-release/opus_core
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/latest-stable-release/urbansim
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/latest-stable-release/urbansim_gridcell
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/latest-stable-release/eugene
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/latest-stable-release/opus_gui
</pre>

<p> Notice that this time we are in the <tt>src</tt> directory when
checking out individual packages.  The <tt>cd</tt> command above works directly for Mac and Linux.  On Windows the character for subdirectories is <tt>\</tt> instead of <tt>/</tt>, so
the initial command is <tt>cd opus\src</tt> instead.</p>

<h3>Option 2: Getting Opus and UrbanSim using subversion and Eclipse</h3>
This is the best option if you'll be doing software development. &nbsp;See <a href="ide_setup.html">Installing Opus and UrbanSim using an IDE</a> for details.<br>

<h2><a name="updating">Updating to a New Stable Release</h2>

<p>If you don't have any configurations and data of your own, the easiest course is just to delete your
existing <tt>opus</tt> directory and get a fresh zip file.  If you do have configurations or data and you
checked out the latest stable release using the URL 
https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/latest-stable-release/, then all you need to do to update
if there is a new stable release is to open a shell or DOS window, navigate to the opus/src directory that 
holds the source code, and use the svn update command:
<pre>
cd opus/src
svn update
</pre>

If you checked out a specific numbered version for a stable release, want to switch to a different specific
numbered version, or want to switch to the latest development version, you can use the <tt>switch</tt> command 
to svn to update your working copy of the code to a different version.  For example, 
if you checked out all the packages and want to update to version 4.2.1, do this:

<pre>
cd opus
svn switch https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/4.2.1/ src
</pre>

<p>If you update the code you may need to update your data and configurations as well.  The
<a href="http://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/ReleaseNotes">Release Notes</a> 
should give information on any updates that are needed.</p>


<h2><a name="dev_version">Getting the Source Code for the Latest Development Version</h2>

<p>For the development version, you need to check out the
source code directly from our subversion repository.  (The <tt>src</tt> subdirectory
of the zip file with the sample data and configurations is empty for the development
version since the source code changes frequently.)  Follow the above directions, except that use a
different URL for the code.  For example, to check out all the Opus packages at once, use:
<pre>
cd opus
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/trunk/ src
</pre>


<p>Or if you've already checked out a stable release, here's how to switch from a stable release to 
the development version (again assuming you checked out all the packages):</p>

<pre>
cd opus
svn switch https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/trunk/ src
</pre>
