<h1>Downloading the Opus/UrbanSim Sample Data and Source Code</h1>

<h2>Getting the Sample Data and Configurations</h2>

<p>We provide a zip file that includes sample data for Eugene and Seattle projects, template configurations for running simulations 
using these projects, and a directory in which to insert the source code.  
Download the zip file with data for the latest development version 
from <a href="http://www.urbansim.org/download/#latest_dev">this page</a>.
Unzip the file, which will result in a directory called <tt>opus</tt> with various subdirectories.  Put
this directory some convenient place on your local disk. (We suggest putting it in your home directory.)
See <a href="opus_directory_tree.html">Opus Directory Tree</a> for more information on these directories and
sample data.</p>

<h2>Getting the Source Code</h2>

<p>For the development version, you should check out the
source code directly from our subversion repository. &nbsp;(For you modeler
types, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>
in this context is the name of a version control system that nicely
manages keeping track of different versions of the code; we're not
talking politics.) &nbsp;Using subversion, it is easy to update to newer versions of
Opus/UrbanSim and merge in any changes you've made. &nbsp;You can also
request any particular version of the code from subversion.
&nbsp;However, you do have to have a subversion client installed on
your machine.</p>

<p>Here are two ways to get the code. The source code directory will have subdirectories with
the code for opus_core, urbansim, and other packages, and also a file
docs with all of the documentation for that version. &nbsp;The manual
is in the subdirectory <i>opus_docs/manual</i> of the opus workspace, 
and the tutorials are in the <i>tutorials</i> subdirectory.</p>


<h3>Option 1: Getting Opus and UrbanSim using a command line interface to subversion</h3>

<p>First, make sure you have a subversion client installed (<tt>svn</tt>). If not, you can get one 
from <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html</a>. &nbsp;
Next, in a shell (i.e. a terminal window or DOS window), type the following commands.  These commands assume you start the shell in
whatever directory holds your <tt>opus</tt> directory.</p>
<pre>
cd opus/src
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/trunk/opus_core
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/trunk/urbansim
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/trunk/urbansim_gridcell
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/trunk/eugene
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/trunk/opus_gui
</pre>

(The commands above work directly for Mac and Linux.  On Windows the character for subdirectories is <tt>\</tt> instead of <tt>/</tt>, so
the initial command is <tt>cd opus\src</tt> instead.)

<p>This checks out just the minimal set of packages needed for the tutorial.  If you have a fast
connection, you can get all of the Opus packages at once using these commands:
<pre>
cd opus
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/trunk/ src
</pre>

<p>Notice that this time we are doing the svn checkout one directory level up, and
checking out all the packages into the <tt>src</tt> directory.
      
<p>The above commands check out the latest development version of the code -- adjust the URLs 
appropriately to get a stable release.  See <a href="releases.html">Opus Revisions and Releases</a>
for details on how to do this.</p>

<h3>Option 2: Getting Opus and UrbanSim using subversion and Eclipse</h3>
This is the best option if you'll be doing software development. &nbsp;See <a href="ide_setup.html">Installing Opus and UrbanSim using an IDE</a> for details.<br>
