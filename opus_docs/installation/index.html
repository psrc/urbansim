<h1>Installing Opus &amp; UrbanSim</h1>


<p>This section provides instructions for installing Opus, UrbanSim, as well as the
external software required by Opus and UrbanSim.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Opus and UrbanSim are intended to be platform-independent. We
have successfully installed and used the system under the Windows, Linux, and Macintosh operating systems. These
installation directions have been tested with Windows XP, SuSe Linux, and Macintosh OS X Version 10.4.5 with
both PPC and Intel processors.</p>

<p>Opus and UrbanSim rely on numerous other open-source systems, in
particular <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>,
<a href="http://code.enthought.com/traits/">Traits</a> and a non-trivial set of Python packages. Fortunately, on Windows, the
<a href="http://code.enthought.com/enthon/"> Enthought
Python Edition for Windows</a> installs both Python and all of the Python packages needed by Opus and UrbanSim.&nbsp;
For Linux and Macintosh, however , there is not (yet) such a bundled set of
packages, so the process of installing
all the supporting software on those systems can be a bit tedious, although hopefully straightforward.</p>

<p>Opus and UrbanSim work with Python 2.4 or 2.5.&nbsp; In general, we recommend you use the most recent
snapshot of these external
applications, though if you are have problems, try using one of the versions
mentioned here.&nbsp; These instructions assume you are using Python 2.5.1. &nbsp;
If you are using different versions, adjust the instructions accordingly.</p>

<p>To help illustrate how to setup UrbanSim for use by your own agency, these
installation directions sometimes refer to a fictitious Atlantis
Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO). Where you see the word
&ldquo;atlantis&rdquo; you may safely
substitute the appropriate name for your application.</p>

<p>The installation steps vary according to the operating system being used:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="windows_install.html">Installation instructions for Windows</a></li>

  <li><a href="linux_install.html">Installation instructions for Linux</a> (in the process of being updated for Python 2.5)</li>

  <li><a href="mac_install.html">Installation instructions for Macintosh OS X </a></li>

</ul>

<p><a href="release_notes.html">Check the release notes</a> for significant code
or data changes.&nbsp; If you have your own Opus package or an existing baseyear
database you may need to modify your code and data.</p>
<p>The result of an install will be a number of packages in the Python
'site-packages' directory for the supporting software, and a
'workspace' directory that holds Opus and UrbanSim. &nbsp;The workspace
directory will look something like this on Windows (with an analogous
structure on other platforms):</p>

<pre>C:\opusworkspace<br>    atlantis/<br>        docs/<br>        ... <i>(more directories and files) ...</i>
        __init__.py
        opus_package_info.p
    opus_core/
    urbansim/
    ... <i>(more Opus packages) ...</i></pre>


<h1>Uninstalling Opus</h1>

<p>If you no longer wish to have Opus on your computer, just remove the
workspace directory from your Python path, and delete that directory.
&nbsp;(If you want to save space, you can also uninstall any supporting
software that you downloaded just to use with Opus.)</p>
