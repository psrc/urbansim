<h1>Installing Opus &amp; UrbanSim</h1>


<p>This section provides instructions for installing Opus, UrbanSim, as well as the
external software required by Opus and UrbanSim.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Opus and UrbanSim are intended to be platform-independent. We
have successfully installed and used the system under the Windows, Linux, 
and Macintosh operating systems. These
installation directions have been tested with Windows XP, SuSe Linux, and 
Macintosh OS X Versions 10.4 and 10.5 with Intel processors, and version 10.4 with PPC processor.</p>

<p>Opus and UrbanSim rely on numerous other open-source systems, in
particular <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>,
<a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt</a>, and a non-trivial set of Python packages. 
For Windows, we've written an installer, which takes care of downloading Python and the required packages.
For Linux and Macintosh, however, there is not (yet) such a bundled set of
packages, so the process of installing
all the supporting software on those systems can be a bit tedious, although hopefully straightforward.</p>

<p>Opus and UrbanSim work with Python 2.5.&nbsp; In general, we recommend you use the most recent
snapshot of these external
applications, though if you are have problems, try using one of the versions
mentioned here.&nbsp; These instructions assume you are using Python 2.5.1. &nbsp;
If you are using different versions, adjust the instructions accordingly.</p>

<p>To help illustrate how to setup UrbanSim for use by your own agency, these
installation directions sometimes refer to a fictitious Atlantis
Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO). Where you see the word
&ldquo;atlantis&rdquo; you may safely
substitute the appropriate name for your application.</p>

<p>The installation steps vary according to the operating system being used:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="windows_install_installer.html">Installation instructions for Windows (using an installer)</a></li>

  <li><a href="windows_install.html">Installation instructions for Windows (installing by hand)</a></li>

  <li><a href="linux_install.html">Installation instructions for Linux</a></li>

  <li><a href="mac_install.html">Installation instructions for Macintosh OS X </a></li>

</ul>

<p>We currently have an installer available for Windows, which will be easier to use than 
installing all the packages by hand.  Unfortunately for Linux and Mac, right now installing 
by hand is the only option.</P>

<p><a href="http://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/ReleaseNotes">Check the release notes</a> 
for significant code or data changes.&nbsp; If you have your own Opus package or an existing baseyear
database you may need to modify your code and data.</p>

<p>The result of an install will be a number of packages in the Python
'site-packages' directory for the supporting software, and an <a href="opus_directory_tree.html">Opus directory tree</a>
that holds the source code, sample project data, and xml configurations for use by the GUI.

<h1>Uninstalling Opus</h1>

<p>If you no longer wish to have Opus on your computer, just remove the
Opus source code directory from your Python path, delete any other environment variables,
and delete the Opus directory tree.
&nbsp;(If you want to save space, you can also uninstall any supporting
software that you downloaded just to use with Opus.)</p>
