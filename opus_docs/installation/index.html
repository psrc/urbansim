<h1>Installing Opus &amp; UrbanSim</h1>


<p>This section provides instructions for installing Opus, UrbanSim, as well as the
external software required by Opus and UrbanSim.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Opus and UrbanSim are intended to be platform-independent. We
have successfully installed and used the system under the Windows, Linux, 
and Macintosh operating systems. These
installation directions have been tested with Windows XP, SuSe Linux, and 
Macintosh OS X Versions 10.4 and 10.5 with Intel processors, and version 10.4 with PPC processor.</p>

<p>Opus and UrbanSim rely on numerous other open-source systems, in
particular <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>,
<a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt</a>, and a non-trivial set of Python packages. 
For Windows, we've written an installer, which takes care of downloading Python and the required packages.
For Linux and Macintosh, however, there is not (yet) such a bundled set of
packages, so the process of installing
all the supporting software on those systems can be a bit tedious, although hopefully straightforward.</p>

<p>We have different versions of the installation instructions for the various operating systems:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="windows_install_installer.html">Installation instructions for Windows (using an installer)</a></li>

  <li><a href="windows_install.html">Installation instructions for Windows (installing by hand)</a></li>

  <li><a href="linux_install.html">Installation instructions for Linux</a></li>

  <li><a href="mac_install.html">Installation instructions for Macintosh OS X </a></li>

</ul>

<p>We currently have an installer available for Windows, which will be easier to use than 
installing all the packages by hand.  Unfortunately for Linux and Mac, right now installing 
by hand is the only option.</P>

<p><a href="http://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/ReleaseNotes">Check the release notes</a> 
for significant code or data changes.&nbsp; If you have your own Opus package or an existing baseyear
database you may need to modify your code and data.</p>

<p>The result of an install will be an <a href="opus_directory_tree.html">Opus directory tree</a>
that holds the source code, sample project data, and xml configurations for use by the GUI.

<h2>Additional Installation Instructions</h2>

<p>Here are some additional instructions for particular situations:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="ide_setup.html">Configuring an Interactive Development Environment</a> (for programmers)</li>
<li><a href="latex.html">Writing and Formatting Opus Documentation using the LaTeX Document Preparation System</a></li>
<li><a href="64_bit.html">Running Opus &amp; UrbanSim on 64 Bit Machines</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Uninstalling Opus</h2>

<p>If you no longer wish to have Opus on your computer, just remove the
Opus source code directory from your Python path, delete any other environment variables,
and delete the Opus directory tree.
&nbsp;(If you want to save space, you can also uninstall any supporting
software that you downloaded just to use with Opus.)</p>
