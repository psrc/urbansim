<h1>Installing Opus &amp; UrbanSim on Macintosh OS X</h1>


<p>This following instructions are for installing Opus &amp;
UrbanSim on
Macintosh OS X.&nbsp; These installation directions have been
tested with
Macintosh OS X Tiger and Leopard with Intel processors. </p>

</ol>


<h2>Step 1: <a name="python">Installing Python</a>&nbsp;</h2>


<p>Opus and UrbanSim are implemented in Python, making heavy use
of numerical
Python packages and other software. For the Mac we recommend using
Python version 2.5.1.  Mac OS X Leopard (10.5) comes with Python 2.5.1 
already installed, so you don't need to update your version of Python.  If you are
running an earlier version of the OS (10.4.9 or earlier), the default version
will be 2.3.5 or earlier and you will need to update to Python 2.5.1.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.python.org">official
Python website</a> includes documentation, downloads, and much
else.  Go to the <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python
download tab</a>
and get "Python 2.5.1 for Macintosh OS X". This is an
installer that works on both PPC and Intel Macs. Double-click on the
image to mount it, then double-click on the MacPython.mpkg package icon
to install. When you're done you can unmount the image by clicking on
the triangle symbol next to it in the Finder. </p>


<p>A note on Python versions: Tiger comes with Python version
2.3.5 installed. &nbsp;However, the universal installers for the
required packages are only available
for newer versions of Python, so you need a newer version. (We
&nbsp;suggest leaving Apple's installed version alone - there is no
need to uninstall it. When you install Python 2.5 the installer will
put it earlier on the search path so that it will be found instead. You
can still get to the old version via /usr/bin/python.)</p>


<h2>(optional) Step 2: <a name="mysql">Installing MySQL</a></h2>

<p>MySQL is an efficient, open-source SQL database.  You don't need it to run the 
basic Eugene tutorial, although for serious use with your own dataset you will want
a database of some sort.  (We are steadily reducing the dependencies on the particular
database used, however, with the goal of allowing Opus and UrbanSim to be used with
any SQL database.)  If you use MySQL you can either have a local copy or run on a shared server.</p>

<p>If you don't install MySQL right away, you can return and install it later if you discover you 
need it.</>

<p>Opus works with MySQL 4.1 and 5.0.</p>

<ol>


  <li> Choose which version of MySQL to use, and download the
binary installer for your version of the OS and processor type from <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/</a>.
  </li>


  <li>Install and configure MySQL.</li>


</ol>


<p>In addition to MySQL itself, you might get the <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/tools/query-browser/">MySQL
Query Browser</a> (for prowling around in UrbanSim databases
using a graphical
interface), and the <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/tools/administrator/">MySQL
Administrator</a>. These are both available as binaries.</p>


<p>See the <a href="mysqlinstall.4.1.html">Opus/UrbanSim
MySQL Installation and Configuration Page</a>
for additional specific configuration steps. &nbsp;This page is
written
for Windows, but is straightforward to use for the Mac as well.</p>


<h2>Step 3: <a name="libraries">Installing Python
Libraries</a></h2>


<p> Unfortunately, there is no download for the Mac that contains
all of the Python libraries needed by Opus and UrbanSim, so several steps are
needed to install the Python libraries.  In most cases, obtaining these packages
 is made simpler by the use of Easy Install, a python module that can help you 
 download and build python packages.  For more on Easy Install, <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall">visit the PEAK webpage</a>.

<p>Download <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py">ez_setup.py</a> to 
	your computer.  Run it (from the directory it's in) by typing
	
<pre>$ python ez_setup.py</pre>

We will use this later to install a number of packages.</p>

<p>Now you can start downloading python packages.</p>

<p>If you are running a version of OS X earlier than 10.5, such as 10.4.9, download and install the following:
<ul>

<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython2.6-osx-unicode-2.6.3.3-universal10.4-py2.5.dmg?download">wxPython 2.6.3.3</a> from sourceforge. Later versions of wxPython will not work.</li>

<li><b>pytz</b> from <a href="http://pythonmac.org/packages/py25-fat/index.html">the downloads page on pythonmac.org</a>.  This is also not necessary on 10.5/Leopard.</li>

<li><b>python-dateutil</b>, also from <a href="http://pythonmac.org/packages/py25-fat/index.html">pythonmac.org</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you are running 10.5/Leopard, the three packages above are not necessary.</p>

<p>Now download and install the Superpack from <a href="http://trichech.us/?page_id=5">http://trichech.us/?page_id=5</a>.
  This includes the packages NumPy 1.0.4, SciPi 0.7 and mathplotlib 0.90.1, all of which are necessary.</p>

Install the following packages using Easy Install:

<ul>

	<li><b>Traits:</b>  Go to <pre>http://code.enthought.com/enstaller/eggs/macosx/</pre> and navigate 
	to the correct package, which will have a name like <pre>enthought.traits-2.0.1b1-py2.5-macosx-10.3-fat.egg</pre>
	or something similar.  Download it, and then use
	<pre>$ easy_install [<i>filename</i>]</pre>
	to install it.</li>

	 <li><b>SQLAlchemy 0.4:</b> Download the tarball (currently for SQLAlchehmy 0.4 from 
	 <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/download.html">http://www.sqlalchemy.org/download.html</a>.  
	 Then run the command
	 <pre>$ easy_install [<i>filename</i>]</pre>
	 where [<i>filename</i>] is the path of the file you just downloaded. (As of this writing the name of the file you want is SQLAlchemy-0.4.0.tar.gz.)</li>

 </ul>


<br>


<br>


Install any or all of these optional Python packages.  For each, it is probably easiest to download the tarball and then use easy install.
<ul>

  <li>If you are using R, install <b>RPy</b> (<a href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/">http://rpy.sourceforge.net/</a>).&nbsp;
This is a Python interface for the statistical programming language R
(tested with version 0.4.6).</li>


  <li>If you need to use .dbf files (for example, those produced
by ArcGIS), install <b>dbfpy</b> (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dbfpy">http://sourceforge.net/projects/dbfpy</a>).</li>

 	<li>If you are using MySQL, download <b>MySQL-python</b> (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python</a>).
 	You may need to put /usr/local/mysql/bin into your path before installing mysql-python to avoid getting an error.</li>
    	
</ul>

<p>You may get the following error after building and installing MySQL-python 1.2.2 on 10.3.9:
<i><br>ImportError: dlcompat: dyld: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python can't open library: /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient_r.15.dylib  (No such file or directory, errno = 2)</i>
<br>This may happen because the library it is looking for is in /usr/local/mysql/lib/, and not in a subfolder called mysql.  Moving the files or creating aliases should fix the problem.</p>

<h2>Step 4: <a name="opus">Installing Opus and
UrbanSim</a></h2>


<p>There are two options for getting the Opus/UrbanSim code: as a zip
file, or direct from our subversion repository. &nbsp;(For you modeler
types, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>
in this context is the name of a version control system that nicely
manages keeping track of different versions of the code; we're not
talking politics.) &nbsp;Particularly if you will be modifying or
adding to the Opus/Urbansim code, we recommend using subversion.
&nbsp;This will make it easy to update to newer versions of
Opus/UrbanSim and merge in any changes you've made. &nbsp;You can also
request any particular version of the code from subversion.
&nbsp;However, you do have to have a subversion client installed on
your machine.</p>

<p>Here are instructions for each of these options. &nbsp;(Well, actually, we're going to give you two ways
to get Opus and UrbanSim using subversion, depending on whether you are
using the Eclipse IDE. &nbsp;So OK, that's 3 options in all.)</p>
<p>For each of these options, you construct a workspace, called say '/Users/yourusername/opusworkspace'. You'll then need to
add&nbsp;/Users/yourusername/opusworkspace to your Python path (see <a href="mac_install.html#Step_5:_Defining_Environment_Variables_">Step 5</a>
for how to do this). &nbsp;The workspace will have subdirectories with
the code for opus_core, urbansim, and other packages, and also a file
docs with all of the documentation for that version. &nbsp;The manual
is in the subdirectory <i>opus_docs/manual</i> of the opus workspace, 
and the tutorials are in the <i>tutorials</i> subdirectory.</p>

<h3>Option 1: Getting Opus and UrbanSim as a zip file</h3>

This is the simplest option. &nbsp;Browse to our downloads page, and select a zip file for a
stable release. &nbsp;(Probably you want the latest stable release.)
&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Caution: don't get the 2006
release if you are using these directions! &nbsp;That uses an older set
of instructions on doing an install.</span> &nbsp;Get a 2007 release or later.<br>
<br>
Create a workspace directory, say
'/Users/yourusername/opusworkspace', and unzip the file there.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hint</span>: if you find yourself
starting to edit the source code in any of the packages you downloaded,
stop, delete the workspace directory, and get the code using subversion
instead. &nbsp;You'll have a much easier time later if you update your
code.
<h3>Option 2: Getting Opus and UrbanSim using a command line interface to subversion</h3>

p>Suppose you want to get stable release 4.1.1.
First, make sure you have a subversion client installed. &nbsp;If not, you can get one 
from <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html</a>. &nbsp;
Next, in a shell (i.e. a terminal window), type the following commands:</p>
<pre>
mkdir opusworkspace
cd opusworkspace
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/4.1.1/opus_core
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/4.1.1/urbansim
svn checkout https://trondheim.cs.washington.edu/svn/opus/tags/4.1.1/eugene
</pre>

<p>The above commands check out stable release 4.1.1 -- adjust the URLs appropriately to get a
different stable release.  See <a href="releases.html">Opus Revisions and Releases</a>
for details on this, on getting all of the packages at once instead of one by one,
on checking out the development version instead of a stable release, etc.
</p>

<h3>Option 3: Getting Opus and UrbanSim using subversion and Eclipse</h3>
This is the best option if you'll be doing software development. &nbsp;See <a href="ide_setup.html">Installing Opus and UrbanSim using an IDE</a> for details.<br>

<h2><a name="Step_5:_Defining_Environment_Variables_"></a>Step 5: <a name="environment">Defining
Environment Variables</a>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>UrbanSim requires the following environment variables.&nbsp; The first
tells the Python interpreter where to find the Opus/UrbanSim code.  The remaining
variables describe how to connect to MySQL -- leave those four out if you aren't
installing MySQL.</p>

<ul>


  <li><b>PYTHONPATH</b> - This environment variable
tells Python where to look for files outside of Python's
'site-packages' directory (which is the default location for Python
installers). Change PYTHONPATH to include the path to the directory
containing your 'workspace' that you defined in Step 4, e.g.
'/Users/yourname/opusworkspace'.&nbsp; On 10.5 or later, you also need to add the diretory
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages, as the preinstalled
 version of Python uses a different directory for sitepackages.  Finally, make sure your directory
  with enthought/traits is on the PYTHONPATH.</li>

  <li><b>MYSQLHOSTNAMEFORTESTS</b> - This environment
variable is only used for running unit tests that use MySQL. These
tests use the MySQL database hostname described by this environment
variable. If this environment variable is not defined, unit tests that
expect this database server will not run, but will instead print a
warning message.</li>


  <li><b>MYSQLHOSTNAME</b> - The name of the MySQL
server. Use <font face="Courier New" size="2">localhost</font>
for the MySQL server on the same computer.&nbsp;</li>


  <li><b>MYSQLUSERNAME</b> - This should have the
MySQL user name to be used for querying the UrbanSim database. In the
lab, we use the MySQL username "urbansim" as a convenient way to allow
sharing scripts among all the lab members. (Note that MySQL user names
are independent of login names.)&nbsp;</li>


  <li><b>MYSQLPASSWORD</b> - The password for the
MySQL user name given above.&nbsp;</li>



</ul>


<p>On the Mac under OS X, the way to set environment variables is
via an XML
file '.MacOSX/environment.plist' in the user's home directory so that
the
environment variables are seen by the various different shells (see <a href="http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1067.html">http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1067.html</a>).
Here is the sample contents of the file for these variables:</p>


<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br>&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"<br>"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;<br>&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;<br> &lt;dict&gt;<br> &lt;key&gt;DISPLAY&lt;/key&gt;<br> &lt;string&gt;:0.0&lt;/string&gt;<br><br> &lt;key&gt;MYSQLHOSTNAME&lt;/key&gt;<br> &lt;string&gt;localhost&lt;/string&gt;<br><br> &lt;key&gt;MYSQLUSERNAME&lt;/key&gt;<br> &lt;string&gt;urbansim&lt;/string&gt;<br><br> &lt;key&gt;MYSQLPASSWORD&lt;/key&gt;<br> &lt;string&gt;thesecretpassword&lt;/string&gt;<br><br> &lt;key&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/key&gt;<br> &lt;string&gt;/Users/yourusername/opusworkspace&lt;/string&gt;<br><br> &lt;/dict&gt;<br>&lt;/plist&gt;</pre>


<h2>Step 6: <a name="test">Testing your installation</a></h2>


<p>Follow <a href="test_install.html">these
instructions</a> to test your
installation.</p>

<h2>Step 7: <a name="create_package">(optional) Creating your own Opus package</a></h2>

<p>If you want to create your own Opus package in which to place your code, follow these&nbsp;<a href="create_opus_package.html">instructions to create an Opus package</a>. &nbsp;You don't need to do this though just to run the Eugene tutorial, or otherwise use an existing database.</p>
