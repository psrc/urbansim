<h1>Migrating from UrbanSim 3 to UrbanSim 4</h1>

<p>This document describes the steps necessary to migrate an
UrbanSim 3 application to work with UrbanSim 4.</p>

<p>If you find any omissions or errors, please report them to
bugs at urbansim dot org.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>General Comments</h2>

<p>Be careful to use the same version of the documentation as
the code, since the documentation and code continue to change
daily.</p>

<p>UrbanSim 4 does not have a consistency checker.&nbsp; In
general, the consistency constraints of UrbanSim 3 still apply
to UrbanSim 4, unless the relevant database table columns have
changed in their semantics (see the list of table changes,
below).</p>

<p>The "configurations" mentioned in the manual are
similar to the "scenario file" used in UrbanSim 3,
though they use different technology.&nbsp; Both specify how to
setup or configure the simulation.&nbsp; The UrbanSim 4
configuration allows you to configure much more of the
simulation than was possible with the scenario file.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do not have NULL values in any database column used by
UrbanSim 4.&nbsp; If you do, UrbanSim 4 will fail in confusing
ways.</p>

We recommend that you use lower-case names for databases, tables, and
columns.&nbsp; Our experience is that using a single case for all
of these avoids problems if you ever need to migrate your data to
another database system or operating system.&nbsp; Opus converts
all table and column
names into lower-case when it creates a dataset from a database
table.
<p>The set of variables used by a model is determined completely
by the model's specification.&nbsp; Thus, it is impossible for our
User Manual to document the set of variables used by a model.
</p>

<p>The set of variable names implemented in UrbanSim 4's <i>urbansim</i>
package is different than those that came with UrbanSim 3.&nbsp;
Some UrbanSim 3 variables have no direct counter-part in
UrbanSim 4, and UrbanSim 4 contains many variables not found in
UrbanSim 3.</p>

<p>UrbanSim 4 makes it clearer that the set of appropriate
accessibility variables depends upon the region being modeled,
and the particular implementation of the region's travel
model.&nbsp; Thus, in UrbanSim 4, the accessibility variables
are packaged in the <i>psrc</i> package that is used to
specialize UrbanSim to run on the Puget Sound Regional Council's
metropolitan area.</p>

<p>The use of development type is much less prominent in
UrbanSim 4, since the developer model now is a location choice
model where projects (agents) choose from gridcells
(locations).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>User lower-case for the name of any Python package containing
a module defining an Opus variable.&nbsp; For instance, the
Python package 'gridcell' within <i>urbansim</i> must be
lower-case, so that Opus can find the Opus variables defined
within that package, e.g. 'urbansim.gridcell.acres_of_land'.</p>

<p>We recommend using lower-case for the name of all Python
packages.</p>

<p>Use lower-case for any Opus variable names.</p>

<h2>Changes to Specific <a name="baseyear">
Baseyear Database</a>
Tables</h2>

<p>This section describes the specific changes needed to be made
to the tables in the baseyear database.</p>

<h4 align="left">accessibilities</h4>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p align="left">This table is no longer used in
UrbanSim 4.&nbsp; Instead, the data are drawn directly from the
travel_data table.
    </p>

  </li>

</ul>

<h4 align="left">accessibilities_input</h4>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p align="left">This table is no longer used in
UrbanSim 4.&nbsp; Instead, the data are drawn directly from the
travel_data table.
    </p>

  </li>

</ul>

<h4 align="left">annual_employment_control_totals</h4>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p align="left">No longer uses column
'total_employment'. </p>

  </li>

  <li>See the MySQL script <a href="annual_employment_control_totals.txt">annual_employment_control_totals.txt</a>
that was used to convert the Eugene 1980 Baseyear database to the
UrbanSim4 format</li>

</ul>

<h4 align="left">developer_model_coefficients<br>

developer_model_specification</h4>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p align="left">The developer model as it existed in
Java is no longer in UrbanSim 4.&nbsp; Instead, there is a family
of development project location choice models, one for each type of
building, that determine where to place new development
projects.&nbsp; The set of development projects to build is
computed by randomly sampling from the historical set of development
projects until enough development has been scheduled for the current
year.&nbsp; For more details, see the Users Manual.
    </p>

  </li>

</ul>

<h4 align="left">development_constraints</h4>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p align="left">The 'plan_type_x' field (that could
contain multiple plan types) has been replaced with the 'plan_type_id'
field (that contains either a -1 for "don't care" or a single plan type
id).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p align="left">The 'devtype_x' field is no longer
used. </p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p align="left">This table now has six additional
columns, specifying the development constraint for gridcells matching
the rest of the field values (except for the constraint_id). </p>

    <ul>

      <li>
        <p align="left">min_units </p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <p align="left">max_units </p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <p align="left">min_commercial_sqft </p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <p align="left">max_commercial_sqft </p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <p align="left">min_industrial_sqft </p>

      </li>

      <li> max_industrial_sqft</li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li> The conversion process for this table is a very manual
process. It would be difficult if not impossible to write a script to
do this. In general though, this is what we did to convert the UrbanSim
v3 table to v4. The development_constraints, development_types, and
plan_types tables were all exported to an Excel document for ease of
manipulation. I sorted the development_constraints table by plantype_x
then devtype_x. Then for each unique plantype_x, I wrote down which
devtype_x numbers were not accounted for. This represented for each
plantype_x what devtype's were allowed. I made a new
development_constraints table with the appropriate format (see above),
and entered for each plan_type_id all of the appropriate numbers in
each field (various commercial/industrial sqft and residential unit
min/max numbers). This took care of constraining land conversions based
on zoning. The next issue was constraining land conversions based on
locational/environmental attributes. In the Eugene case it was easy, if
a cell was in a wetland, outside the urban growth boundary, in a stream
buffer, on a steep slope, or in a floodplain, no development was
allowed, so a zero went in each field. Your application may be
substantially more complicated than this because various combinations
of zoning and environmental attributes may be combined. You may have 2
or more records for a plan_type_id in a case where you may constrain
differently depending on combinations of attributes.</li>

</ul>

<h4 align="left">development_events_exogenous</h4>

<p align="left">This table replaces the development_events
table used in
UrbanSim 3.&nbsp; It uses the same schema, except that all of the
improvement_value fields must contain 'A' (for adding units or
sqft).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">This name change was done since the
development_events dataset
will contain both prescheduled development events from the
development_events_exogenous table as well as development events
created by the
sequence of development_project_transition model (to create new
development
projects; not events), the *_development_project_location_choice_models
(to
place those projects), the development_event_transition_model (to
convert the
development projects into development events), and the
events_coordinator (to
process those newly created events).</p>

<h4 align="left">development_event_history</h4>

<ul>

  <li>
Removed the following fields, since
they were not being used: 
    <ul>

      <li>commercial_improvement_value_change_type</li>

      <li>industrial_improvement_value_change_type</li>

      <li>governmental_sqft_change_type</li>
      <li>development_type_change_type</li>

  <li>See the MySQL script <a href="development_event_history.txt">development_event_history.txt</a>
that was used to convert the Eugene 1980 Baseyear database to the
UrbanSim4 format</li>

</ul>

<h4 align="left">development_types</h4>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p align="left">The "primary_use_id" column is no
longer used, and thus may be dropped from this table.
    </p>

  </li>

</ul>

<h4 align="left">employment_adhoc_sector_groups</h4>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p align="left">The "elc_sector"
and "scalable_sector" are no longer used to determine which
employment location choice model to use for choosing the
location for a job.&nbsp; Thus, they may be deleted from that
table. Instead, the model to use for a job is determined as
follows: </p>

    <ul>

      <li>
        <p align="left">Use the <i>Non-Home-Based
Employment Location Choice Model </i>
for non-home-based jobs whose employment sector is listed in the
non_home_based_employment_location_choice_model_specification
table. </p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <p align="left">Use the <i>Home-Based
Employment Location Choice Model </i> for
home-based jobs whose employment sector is listed in the
home_based_employment_location_choice_model_specification table. </p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <p align="left">Use the <i>Scaling
Procedure for Jobs Model </i> for all other jobs. </p>

      </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

</ul>

<h4 align="left">gridcell</h4>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p align="left">Add three new columns, containing
reasonable, positive (greater than zero) values for each record: </p>

  <li>
    <p align="left">Rename all instances of characteristic
&ldquo;age of head&rdquo; to be

<h4 align="left">jobs</h4>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p align="left">Add a new integer 'building_type'
column defining the type of space used by this job.&nbsp;
Currently, the set of allowable values are hard-coded in the code (we
plan to move these into the configuration at some point) as follows: </p>

    <ul>

      <li>
        <p align="left">1 = commercial sqft </p>

      </li>

      <li>

<h4 align="left">jobs_for_estimation</h4>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p align="left">UrbanSim 4 needs three of these
tables, one for each of the types of employment location choice
model.&nbsp; Each of these three tables contains only jobs to use
for estimating the given type of jobs. </p>

    <ul>

      <li>

</ul>

<h2>Specification and Coefficients Tables </h2>

<p>In UrbanSim 4, the specification and coefficient tables, e.g.
land_price_model_specification and land_price_model_coefficients,
are intermediary tables <i>produced</i> by the running the
integrated estimation process.&nbsp; Thus, if you need to update
the set of variables used by a model, or you need to re-estimate
the coefficients, you should do this by re-running the
estimation process; you probably should never directly edit the
specification or coefficients tables in the database.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Database Tables no Longer Used </h2>

<p>The following tables were used by UrbanSim 3 but are no longer
used by
UrbanSim 4: </p>

<ul>

  <li>household_characteristics_for_hlc </li>

  <li>residential_units_for_home_based_jobs </li>

  <li>sqft_for_non_home_based_jobs</li>

  <li>transition_types</li>
