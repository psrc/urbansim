<indicator-documentation>

<definition>
For each year of interest, this indicator calculates the mean household income in the selected geography.
</definition>

<interpreting-results>
For sub-regional geographies, this indicator will show concentrations of wealth and poverty.
</interpreting-results>

<specification>
Retrieve all of the households in the selected unit of geography, and find the average of their incomes.
</specification>

<principal-uses>
This indicator is useful both for diagnostic and evaluative purposes.  
</principal-uses>

<related-indicators>
<a href="households.xml">Households</a> gives the total number of
households in the selected geography.
</related-indicators>

<how-modeled>
When the geography is the entire region, the value of this indicator is exogenous (in other words, it isn't modeled by Urbansim).
This is because household incomes are
specified by external control totals for each year.  When the geography is smaller, the value of this indicator is modeled 
by UrbanSim itself, since UrbanSim models where households locate within the region.
