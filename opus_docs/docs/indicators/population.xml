<specification>
The value of this indicator is calculated as the sum over 
the number of persons in each household for the selected unit of geography, for the year of interest.
</specification>

<how-modeled>
When the geography is the entire region, the value of this indicator is exogenous (in other words, it isn't modeled by Urbansim).
This is because the total regional population is
specified by external control totals for each year.  When the geography is smaller, the value of this indicator is modeled 
by UrbanSim itself, since UrbanSim models where households locate within the region.  The population in the given unit of
geography is derived by adding the number of people in each household in that unit.
