<h1>Installing Opus &amp; UrbanSim</h1>

<p>This section provides instructions for installing Opus, UrbanSim, and the
external software required by Opus and UrbanSim.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Opus and UrbanSim are intended to be platform-independent. We
have successfully installed and used the system under the Windows, Linux, and Macintosh operating systems. These
installation directions have been tested with Windows XP, SuSe Linux, and Macintosh OS X Version 10.4.5 with
both PPC and Intel processors.</p>
<p>Opus and UrbanSim rely on numerous other open-source systems, in
particular <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>,
<a href="http://code.enthought.com/traits/">Traits</a> and a non-trivial set of Python packages. Fortunately, on Windows, the
<a href="http://code.enthought.com/enthon/"> Enthought
Python Edition for Windows</a> installs both Python and all of the Python packages needed by Opus and UrbanSim.&nbsp;
For Linux and Macintosh, however , there is not (yet) such a bundled set of
packages, so the process of installing
all the supporting software on those systems can be a bit tedious, although hopefully straightforward.</p>
<p>Opus and UrbanSim work with Python 2.4.3 or 2.3.5, and with
MySQL 5.0 or 4.1.18.&nbsp; In general, we recommend you use the most recent
snapshot of these external
applications, though if you are have problems, try using one of the versions
mentioned here.&nbsp; These instructions assume you are using Python 2.4.3 and MySQL 5.0.&nbsp;
If you are using different versions, adjust the
instructions accordingly.</p>
<p>To help illustrate how to setup UrbanSim for use by your own agency, these
installation directions sometimes refer to a fictitious Atlantis Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO). Where you see the word “atlantis” you may safely
substitute the appropriate name for your application.</p>
<p>The installation steps vary according to the operating system being used:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="windows_install.html">Installation instructions for Windows</a></li>
  <li><a href="linux_install.html">Installation instructions for Linux</a></li>
  <li><a href="mac_install.html">Installation instructions for Macintosh OS X</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="release_notes.html">Check the release notes</a> for significant code
or data changes.&nbsp; If you have your own Opus package or an existing baseyear
database you may need to modify your code and data.</p>
<p>Doing all but the last step creates a “Modeler Setup,” in
which the base Opus packages are installed in Python’s ‘site-packages’ directory. This is the most common case. The directory structure
will be similar to the following, where <font face="Courier New" size="2">atlantis</font> is your
own Opus package:</p>

<pre>C:\Python24\Lib\site-packages
    opus_core/
    urbansim/
    ... <i>(more Opus packages) ...</i>

C:\workspace
    atlantis/
        docs/
        ... <i>(more directories and files) ...</i>
        __init__.py
        opus_package_info.py</pre>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">C:\Python24\Lib\site-packages</font> is
the location of Python site-packages on your computer. (For Linux or Macintosh, this line would be different, but would still be the
directory in which Python site-packages are installed.&nbsp; Similarly, <font face="Courier New" size="2"> C:\workspace</font>
would be a subdirectory of your
home user directory.)</p>
<p>Doing the last optional step in the installation steps listed
above produces a “Developer Setup,” with the base Opus packages in your own workspace. This less common case allows you
to edit the base Opus packages. We suggest you only do this if you know you will be changing code in the base
Opus packages. (It’s not hard to change later if you need to.) This setup produces a directory structure similar to:</p>
<pre>C:\workspace
    atlantis/
        docs/
        ... <i>(more directories and files) ...</i>
        __init__.py
        opus_package_info.p
    opus_core/
    urbansim/
    ... <i>(more Opus packages) ...</i></pre>

<h1>Uninstalling Opus</h1>
<p>If you no longer wish to have Opus on your computer, you can uninstall it via
the normal Python mechanisms. If you used the Windows installer, you can
uninstall Opus via the “Add or Remove Programs” application in your Control
Panel; look for a name such as “Python 2.3 opus-0.8”. If you installed it by
unzipping it to a particular directory, just delete that directory.</p>
