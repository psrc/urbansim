\chapter{Upcoming Changes}

Opus and UrbanSim continue to evolve.  This chapter outlines some planned
near-term changes that may impact Opus and UrbanSim users.  (The contents
of this chapter will change regularly, as the changes are made.)

\section{Python 2.5 Upgrade}

Projected timeline: 2007

Python 2.5 \pythonversionindex is scheduled for release in September 2006 and
includes some important improvements for UrbanSim.  In particular, it handles
memory management in a way that will result in more re-use of memory (In Python
2.4 once a block of memory is allocated to int32 storage, it can be freed and
re-used to store other int32 values, but will never be used to store any other
types of values, e.g. not for float32.  This is problematic for Opus.) 

Python 2.5 also provides much better support for 64-bit processors.  If it
works as advertised, then 64-bit processors will have dramatically larger
address spaces, which means that a Python process will be able to access
more than the 2 GB of memory that is the limit for 32-bit processors.  This
should reduce our memory problems.

We plan to migrate to Python 2.5 once the libraries we need have been
converted to Python 2.5.  so presumably sometime later we'll further
migrate to version 2.5. \pythonversionindex
