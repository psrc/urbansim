\chapter{Upcoming Changes}

Opus and UrbanSim continue to evolve.  This chapter outlines some planned
near-term changes that may impact Opus and UrbanSim users.  (The contents
of this chapter will change regularly, as the changes are made.)

\section{Python 2.5 Upgrade}

The ``official'' version of Python for running Opus and UrbanSim is 2.4.3 
or 2.4.4 \pythonversionindex.  However, we have successfully run with
Python 2.5 as well; and at some point we will make 2.5 the official version.
