<h1>Creating a Developer Setup</h1>

<p>This section provides instructions for configuring your computer to do
software development on one or more Opus packages. </p>

<h2>Choosing a Development Environment </h2>

<p>In general, if you are doing much software development, you will benefit a
lot from using an
integrated development environment (IDE) that supports for the range of
activities involved in, such as such as editing code, running tests,
debugging code, connecting to a code repository, etc.&nbsp; There are numerous such IDEs for
Python, and unfortunately no one IDE fits all needs.&nbsp; Within CUSPA, we tend
to use one of three editors for Python, and one of three editors for LaTeX
files. </p>

<p>Configure your Python editor appropriately.&nbsp; The software developers in
CUSPA typically use Eclipse for talking to CVS, Wing for debugging, and either
or both for editing Python code.&nbsp; Here are instructions for <a href="wing.html">configuring Wing</a> and <a href="eclipse.html">configuring
    Eclipse</a>. </p>

<p>If you need to edit the Opus and UrbanSim Reference Manual and Users Guide
(as opposed to just reading it), you’ll need to use <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> since our documentation
is written in LaTeX.&nbsp; Here are instructions for configuring a <a href="latex.html">installing
and configuring a LATEX document preparation system</a>. </p>

<h2>Getting the Code for the CUSPA Opus Packages </h2>

<p>As a developer, you also may need to modify code in one of the Opus packages in the base CUSPA
distribution (e.g. in the installer).&nbsp; If this is the case, you need to get
that code and configure your computer
appropriately so that Python will find the files you want: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Contact <a href="mailto:info@(RemoveBeforeSending)urbansim.org">CUSPA</a>
    to get CVS access to the Opus repositories. </li>
  <li>Download the desired Opus packages from the CUSPA <a href="cvs.html">CVS
    repository</a> and put them into your workspace directory. </li>
  <li>Make sure that your workspace directory is in your PYTHONPATH.&nbsp; This
    will ensure that Python uses these packages instead of the same-named Opus
    packages installed in its 'site-packages' directory.</li>
  <li>(optional) If you wish, you may uninstall the Opus located in Python's
    'site-packages' directory, however this is not strictly necessary since Python will
    use the Opus packages it finds in your PYTHONPATH before it uses the ones
    installed in 'site-packages'.</li>
</ol>

<p>You now should have a directory structure similar to the following: </p>
<pre>C:\workspace
    opus_core/                &lt;-- if this is one of the packages you got from CVS
    urbansim/                 &lt;-- if this is one of the packages you got from CVS
    ...
    atlantis/
        docs/
        ...
        __init__.py
        opus_package_info.py</pre>

<p>Now you can make changes to both the <font face="Courier New" size="2">atlantis</font>
and other Opus packages in your workspace, and use CVS to keep track of the
changes between your copies of the Opus packages and those in the CUSPA
repository, update your copies with changes from the repository, etc. </p>

<p>Note that the code in the CVS repositories is updated frequently (often
multiple times per day). If you do not frequently update your code from the
repositories, it will become very difficult to keep your changes in synch with
the code in the repository. Be warned! </p>

<p>If you make a change that you believe merits inclusion in the CUSPA
repository, please let us know so that we may incorporate that change into the
repository. The more we all improve the code, the better for all of us. </p>

<p>In general, it is a bad idea to directly edit code to Python’s ‘site-packages’
directory (the default location used for most installers, including our
installer).
These changes would be over-written when you upgrade the associated Python
package, e.g. when you upgrade Opus. If you need to modify such code, follow the
directions in this section. </p>
