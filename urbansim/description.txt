all of the required opus and python packages listed below.  If the

not re-install them.  If any are not installed, it will request 
the user to approve (or not) the installation of these packages.
The Opus installer also can be invoked with the request to install
all of the suggested packages, in which case they are added to the
list of packages that are installed before this Opus package is 
installed, as described above.

# The list of src directories to "publish" to the user on install.
# (1) Lists the src/ directories that will be installed for the user.
#     Each listed directory will be installed as a child of src/.
#     This allows for shorter import statements in the code.
# (2) The developer system for Opus will add, to the os.syspath, the 
#     parent of each of these directories, so that the code can 
#     use the same import statements in both developer's world
#     and user's world.
