(0) Note: There is the opus source tree (${PYTHONPATH}), and the opus data directory.
The first is where all the python code it; the second is where
${OPUS_HOME} points to.

(1) Download opus_matsim-yyyy-mm-dd-hhmm.tgz from (TODO:enter source location)  and
and unzip it to a convenient place. After that, you should have a directory called 
opus_matsim.
The opus_matsim directory should have the following subdirectories:

  bin           [[binaries]]
  data          [[scenario input data]]
  jar           [[matsim jar file]]
  matsim_config [[matsim config files]]
  output		[[empty]]
  tmp			[[empty]]

(2) Move the directory into your ${OPUS_HOME} directory.

(3) To test your installation open a command prompt (Windows) or a terminal
  (Mac, Linux) and navigate to opus_matsim/tests in the opus source
  directory containing the packages opus\_core, urbansim, and so forth
  (PYTHONPATH). Don't confuse with the opus\_matsim directory from the previous
  step. Then type

		python travel_model_test.py
	
  This starts a test scenario. If the test completes without errors, your travel
  model plug-in should be working.


NOTE: Instructions how to get and apply the latest MATSim release for UrbanSim will
follow soon. Please check for the latest version of this user guide in the subdirectory
opus\_matsim/docs in your opus source directory (${PYTHONPATH}).
