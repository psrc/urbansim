To install these plugins so that the travel model will work with urbansim...

copy the bank and tripgen directories and paste them in your:
    \travel_model\year_dir\

(eg D:\baseline_travel_model_e05\2000_e05)

This should put the plugin files into the correct location. 

The way to run emme2 is to call the bat file in the tripgen directory (psrctdmG_with_extraction.bat)
* note: this needs to be done for all year_dirs
